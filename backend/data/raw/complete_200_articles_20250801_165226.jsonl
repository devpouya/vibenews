{"title": "El Salvador approves indefinite presidential reelection and extends terms to 6 years", "content": "▶ Lee esta historia en español SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — The party of El Salvador President Nayib Bukele approved constitutional changes in the country’s Legislative Assembly on Thursday that will allow indefinite presidential reelection and extend presidential terms to six years. Lawmaker Ana Figueroa from the New Ideas party had proposed the changes to five articles of the constitution. The proposal also included eliminating the second round of the election where the two top vote-getters from the first round face off. New Ideas and its allies in the Legislative Assembly quickly approved the proposals with the supermajority they hold. The vote passed with 57 in favor and three opposed. Bukele overwhelmingly won reelection last year despite a constitutional ban, after Supreme Court justices selected by his party ruled in 2021 to allow reelection to a second five-year term. Observers have worried that Bukele had a plan to consolidate power since at least 2021, when a newly elected Congress with a strong governing party majority voted to remove the magistrates of the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court. Those justices had been seen as the last check on the popular president. Since then, Bukele has only grown more popular. The Biden administration’s initial expressions of concern gave way to quiet acceptance as Bukele announced his run for reelection. With the return of U.S. President Donald Trump to the White House in January, Bukele had a new powerful ally and quickly offered Trump help by taking more than 200 deportees from other countries into a newly built prison for gang members.  Figueroa argued Thursday that federal lawmakers and mayors can already seek reelection as many times as they want. “All of them have had the possibility of reelection through popular vote, the only exception until now has been the presidency,” Figueroa said. She also proposed that Bukele’s current term, scheduled to end June 1, 2029, instead finish June 1, 2027, to put presidential and congressional elections on the same schedule. It would also allow Bukele to seek reelection to a longer term two years earlier. Marcela Villatoro of the Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena), one of three votes against the proposals, told her fellow lawmakers that “Democracy in El Salvador has died!” “You don’t realize what indefinite reelection brings: It brings an accumulation of power and weakens democracy ... there’s corruption and clientelism because nepotism grows and halts democracy and political participation,” she said. Suecy Callejas, the assembly’s vice president, said that “power has returned to the only place that it truly belongs ... to the Salvadoran people.” Bukele did not immediately comment. Bukele, who once dubbed himself “the world’s coolest dictator,” is highly popular, largely because of his heavy-handed fight against the country’s powerful street gangs. Voters have been willing to overlook evidence that his administration like others before it had negotiated with the gangs, before seeking a state of emergency that suspended some constitutional rights and allowed authorities to arrest and jail tens of thousands of people. His success with security and politically has inspired imitators in the region who seek to replicate his style. Most recently, Bukele’s government has faced international criticism for the arrests of high-profile lawyers who have been outspoken critics of his administration. One of the country’s most prominent human rights group announced in July it was moving its operations out of El Salvador for the safety of its people, accusing the government of a “wave of repression.”", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/el-salvador-nayib-bukele-reelection-f9efd1a08d3c9de2f886f7b911b9417d", "published_date": "2025-08-01T16:47:45.305906", "source": "ap", "topic": "russia-ukraine-conflict", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:47:45.305914", "word_count": 573}
{"title": "Why not enough food is reaching people in Gaza even after Israel eased its blockade", "content": "International outcry over images of emaciated children and increasing reports of hunger-related deaths have pressured Israel to let more aid into the Gaza Strip. This week, Israel paused fighting in parts of Gaza and airdropped food.  But aid groups and Palestinians say the changes have only been incremental and are not enough to reverse what food experts say is a “ worst-case scenario of famine” unfolding in the war-ravaged territory. The new measures have brought an uptick in the number of aid trucks entering Gaza. But almost none of it reaches U.N. warehouses for distribution. Instead, nearly all the trucks are stripped of their cargo by crowds that overwhelm them on the roads as they drive from the borders. The crowds are a mix of Palestinians desperate for food and gangs armed with knives, axes or pistols who loot the goods to then hoard or sell. Many have also been killed trying to grab the aid. Witnesses say Israeli troops often open fire on crowds around the aid trucks, and hospitals have reported hundreds killed or wounded. The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots to control crowds or at people who approach its forces. The alternative food distribution system run by the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has also been marred by violence. International airdrops of aid have resumed. But aid groups say airdrops deliver only a fraction of what trucks can supply. Also, many parcels have landed in now-inaccessible areas that Palestinians have been told to evacuate, while others have plunged into the Mediterranean Sea, forcing people to swim out to retrieve drenched bags of flour.  Palestinians struggle to get donated food at a community kitchen, in Gaza City, northern Gaza Strip, Saturday, July 26, 2025. (AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)  Here’s a look at why the aid isn’t being distributed: The U.N. says that longstanding restrictions on the entry of aid have created an unpredictable environment, and that while a pause in fighting might allow more aid in, Palestinians are not confident aid will reach them. “This has resulted in many of our convoys offloaded directly by starving, desperate people as they continue to face deep levels of hunger and are struggling to feed their families,” said Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA. “The only way to reach a level of confidence is by having a sustained flow of aid over a period of time,” she said.

(Planet Labs PBC via AP)  Israel blocked food entirely from entering Gaza for 2 ½ months starting in March. Since it eased the blockade in late May, it allowed in a trickle of aid trucks for the U.N., about 70 a day on average, according to official Israeli figures. That is far below the 500-600 trucks a day that U.N. agencies say are needed — the amount that entered during a six-week ceasefire earlier this year. Much of the aid is stacked up just inside the border in Gaza because U.N. trucks could not pick it up. The U.N says that was because of Israeli military restrictions on its movements and because of the lawlessness in Gaza. Israel has argued that it is allowing sufficient quantities of goods into Gaza and tried to shift the blame to the U.N. “More consistent collection and distribution by U.N. agencies and international organizations = more aid reaching those who need it most in Gaza,” the Israeli military agency in charge of aid coordination, COGAT, said in a statement this week. With the new measures this week, COGAT, says 220-270 truckloads a day were allowed into Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday, and that the U.N. was able to pick up more trucks, reducing some of the backlog at the border. Palestinians hold onto an aid truck returning to Gaza City on Tuesday, July 22, 2025. (AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi, File)   Cherevko said there have been “minor improvements” in approvals by the Israeli military for its movements and some “reduced waiting times” for trucks along the road. But she said the aid missions are “still facing constraints.” Delays of military approval still mean trucks remain idle for long periods, and the military still restricts the routes that the trucks can take onto a single road, which makes it easy for people to know where the trucks are going, U.N officials say. Antoine Renard, who directs the World Food Program’s operations in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, said Wednesday that it took nearly 12 hours to bring in 52 trucks on a 10-kilometer (6 mile) route.

(Planet Labs PBC via AP)  “While we’re doing everything that we can to actually respond to the current wave of starvation in Gaza, the conditions that we have are not sufficient to actually make sure that we can break that wave,” he said. Aid workers say the changes Israel has made in recent days are largely cosmetic. “These are theatrics, token gestures dressed up as progress,” said Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam’s policy lead for Israel and the Palestinian territories. “Of course, a handful of trucks, a few hours of tactical pauses and raining energy bars from the sky is not going to fix irreversible harm done to an entire generation of children that have been starved and malnourished for months now,” she said.

(AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi, File)    As desperation mounts, Palestinians are risking their lives to get food, and violence is increasing, say aid workers. Muhammad Shehada, a political analyst from Gaza who is a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said aid retrieval has turned into the survival of the fittest. “It’s a Darwin dystopia, the strongest survive,” he said. A truck driver said Wednesday that he has driven food supplies four times from the Zikim crossing on Gaza’s northern border. Every time, he said, crowds a kilometer long (0.6 miles) surrounded his truck and took everything on it after he passed the checkpoint at the edge of the Israeli military-controlled border zones. He said some were desperate people, while others were armed. He said that on Tuesday, for the first time, some in the crowd threatened him with knives or small arms. He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing for his safety. Ali al-Derbashi, another truck driver, said that during one trip in July armed men shot the tires, stole everything, including the diesel and batteries and beat him. “If people weren’t starving, they wouldn’t resort to this,” he said. Israel has said it has offered the U.N. armed escorts. The U.N. has refused, saying it can’t be seen to be working with a party to the conflict – and pointing to the reported shootings when Israeli troops are present.

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana, File)    Israel hasn’t given a timeline for how long the measures it implemented this week will continue, heightening uncertainty and urgency among Palestinians to seize the aid before it ends. Palestinians say the way it’s being distributed, including being dropped from the sky, is inhumane. “This approach is inappropriate for Palestinians, we are humiliated,” said Rida, a displaced woman. Momen Abu Etayya said he almost drowned because his son begged him to get aid that fell into the sea during an aid drop. “I threw myself in the ocean to death just to bring him something,” he said. “I was only able to bring him three biscuit packets”. ___ Associated Press reporters Wafaa Shurafa in Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, Fatma Khaled in Cairo and Michael Biesecker in Washington contributed to this report.", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/aid-gaza-starvation-famine-looting-9fc8e7a652c06d9ae505b43e0c399fc8", "published_date": "2025-08-01T16:47:46.465060", "source": "ap", "topic": "russia-ukraine-conflict", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:47:46.465070", "word_count": 1355}
{"title": "US envoy arrives in Israel to monitor Gaza food distribution as humanitarian crisis worsens", "content": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Israel on Thursday to discuss the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, as the death toll of Palestinians waiting for food and other aid continued to climb. Witkoff and U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee will inspect food distribution in Gaza on Friday, the White House said. At least 91 Palestinians were killed and more than 600 wounded while attempting to get aid in the past 24 hours, the Gaza Health Ministry said Thursday. The victims included 54 people killed while awaiting food in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing on Wednesday, the ministry said. The toll is expected to rise further as many of those killed or wounded were brought to isolated, undersupplied hospitals in northern Gaza and have not yet been counted. Israel’s military said Palestinians surrounded aid trucks and the Israeli military fired warning shots into the crowd, but reported no awareness of injuries resulting from Israeli fire. A security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations, said the gunfire came from within the crowd and resulted from altercations between Palestinians attempting to access aid.  Scenes of desperation and chaos played out again on Thursday as scores of Palestinians ran toward food aid dropped from the air in Zawaida, a city in central Gaza. Aid providers have turned to the skies as border crossings remain closed amid severe food insecurity across the Gaza Strip. The drops have set off stampedes and skirmishes as hungry crowds scream, fight and jostle for the parcels. Eslam al-Telbany, a displaced woman from Jabaliya, said she was carrying a bottle of cooking oil and a sack of flour when she was attacked and bitten, ultimately dropping the items and returning home without aid. “I went and my children prayed that I’d return with food. They haven’t eaten or drank anything for two days,” she said as she wept. Ahmed al-Khatib said someone stole a bag of flour from him, and he broke a tooth in the struggle. Rana Attia, another displaced woman, said people felt more dignified receiving text messages telling them where to collect aid rather than randomly chasing falling parcels under the scorching heat. “We don’t want them to help us that way,” she said. Despite the airdrops, the amount of aid getting into Gaza remains far lower than the 500 to 600 trucks per day that aid organizations say are needed. The Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating humanitarian aid in Gaza said 270 trucks of aid entered Gaza on Wednesday, and 32 pallets of aid were airdropped into the Strip. Under heavy international pressure, Israel announced a series of measures over the weekend to facilitate the entry of more international aid to Gaza. The international community has heaped criticism on Israel over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. International organizations said that Gaza has been on the brink of famine for the past two years, but that recent developments, including a complete blockade on aid for 2 1/2 months, mean that the “worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in Gaza.” German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul arrived in Israel on Thursday on a two-day trip that will also take him to the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Germany, traditionally a staunch ally of Israel, has been increasingly critical recently of Israel’s actions in Gaza. It has insisted that Israel must do more to increase aid supplies and pushed for a ceasefire. Berlin hasn’t joined major allies France, Britain, and Canada in saying it will recognize a Palestinian state in September. But in a statement ahead of his departure Thursday, Wadephul underlined Germany’s position that a two-state solution is “the only way” to ensure a future in peace and security for people on both sides. “For Germany, the recognition of a Palestinian state stands rather at the end of the process. But such a process must begin now. Germany will not move from this aim,” Wadephul said. Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, arrived in Israel on Thursday afternoon and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the humanitarian situation and a possible ceasefire, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. It was the first meeting between Witkoff and Netanyahu since both Israel and the U.S. called their negotiation teams home from Qatar one week ago. Witkoff said at the time that Hamas “shows a lack of desire” to reach a truce. “The fastest way to end the Humanitarian Crises in Gaza is for Hamas to SURRENDER AND RELEASE THE HOSTAGES!!!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Thursday morning. Trump sent Witkoff to the region “in an effort to save lives and end this crisis,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, calling the president “a humanitarian with a big heart.” The war started when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 251 others. They still hold 50 hostages, including around 20 believed to be alive. Most of the others have been released in ceasefires or other deals. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 60,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Its count doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians. The ministry operates under the Hamas government. The U.N. and other international organizations see it as the most reliable source of data on casualties. ___ Fatma Khaled in Cairo, Sam Metz in Jerusalem and Imad Isseid in Ramallah, West Bank, contributed to this report.", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-gaza-war-news-07-31-2025-d9d578ecf303c0f4e8b14074eb980101", "published_date": "2025-08-01T16:47:47.645437", "source": "ap", "topic": "russia-ukraine-conflict", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:47:47.645451", "word_count": 918}
{"title": "Virginia Giuffre’s family expresses shock over Trump saying Epstein ‘stole’ her", "content": "▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration The family of Virginia Giuffre, who was among Jeffrey Epstein’s most well-known sex trafficking accusers, said that it was shocking to hear President Donald Trump say the disgraced financier “stole” Giuffre from him and urged that Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, remain in prison. Giuffre, who had accused Britain’s Prince Andrew and other influential men of sexually exploiting her as a teenager trafficked by Epstein, has been a central figure in conspiracy theories tied to the case. She died by suicide this year. Her family’s statement is the latest development involving Epstein, who took his own life in a New York jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges, and the Republican president, who was his one-time friend. Trump denied prior knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and said he cut off their relationship years ago, but he still faces questions about the case. President Donald Trump said Thursday he “didn’t know” why disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein “stole” young women, including Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, from his Mar-a-Lago spa decades ago but he said he “didn’t like it and we threw him out.” Trump, responding to a reporter’s question on Tuesday, said that he got upset with Epstein over his poaching of workers and that Epstein had stolen Giuffre from his Palm Beach, Florida, club. “It was shocking to hear President Trump invoke our sister and say that he was aware that Virginia had been ‘stolen’ from Mar-a-Lago,” the family’s statement said. “We and the public are asking for answers; survivors deserve this,” it continued. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt noted the president was responding to a reporter’s question and didn’t bring up Giuffre himself.  “The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club for being a creep to his female employees,” she said. The family’s statement comes shortly after the Justice Department interviewed Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 on sex trafficking and other charges and is serving a 20-year sentence in Tallahassee, Florida. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche interviewed Maxwell in a Florida courthouse, though details about what she said haven’t become public. Maxwell’s lawyers have said she testified truthfully and answered questions “about 100 different people.” They have said she’s willing to answer more questions from Congress if she is granted immunity from future prosecution for her testimony and if lawmakers agree to satisfy other conditions. A message seeking comment about the Giuffre family’s statement was sent to Maxwell’s attorney on Thursday. In a CNN interview Thursday evening, Giuffre’s family also spoke out.

(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File)  “She wasn’t stolen, she was preyed upon at his property, at President Trump’s property … stolen seems very impersonal. It feels very much like an object, and the survivors are not objects, women are not objects,” said Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother. “She was preyed upon, and it certainly makes you kind of ask the question, you know, how much he knew during that time?” A Trump administration official said the president is not currently considering clemency action for Maxwell. Giuffre said she was approached by Maxwell in 2000 and eventually was hired by her as a masseuse for Epstein. But the couple effectively made her a sexual servant, she said, pressuring her into gratifying not only Epstein but his friends and associates. Giuffre said she was flown around the world for appointments with men including Prince Andrew while she was 17 and 18 years old. The men, including Andrew, denied it and assailed Giuffre’s credibility. She acknowledged changing some key details of her account. The prince settled with Giuffre in 2022 for an undisclosed sum, agreeing to make a “substantial donation” to her survivors’ organization. The American-born Giuffre lived in Australia for years and became an advocate for sex trafficking survivors after emerging as a central figure in Epstein’s prolonged downfall.

{"title": "Judge blocks Trump administration from ending protections for 60,000 from Central America and Nepal", "content": "▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday against the Trump administration’s plans and extended Temporary Protected Status for 60,000 people from Central America and Asia, including people from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua. Temporary Protected Status is a protection that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people of various nationalities who are in the United States, preventing from being deported and allowing them to work. The Trump administration has aggressively been seeking to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal. It’s part of a wider effort by the administration to carry out mass deportations of immigrants. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem can extend Temporary Protected Status to immigrants in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe to return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions. Noem had ruled to end protections for tens of thousands of Hondurans and Nicaraguans after determining that conditions in their homelands no longer warranted them. The secretary said the two countries had made “significant progress” in recovering from 1998’s Hurricane Mitch, one of the deadliest Atlantic storms in history. The designation for an estimated 7,000 from Nepal was scheduled to end Aug. 5 while protections allowing 51,000 Hondurans and nearly 3,000 Nicaraguans who have been in the U.S. for more than 25 years were set to expire Sept. 8. ◆ Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson in San Francisco did not set an expiration date but rather ruled to keep the protections in place while the case proceeds. The next hearing is Nov. 18.  In a sharply written order, Thompson said the administration ended the migrant status protections without an “objective review of the country conditions” such as political violence in Honduras and the impact of recent hurricanes and storms in Nicaragua. If the protections were not extended, immigrants could suffer from loss of employment, health insurance, be separated from their families, and risk being deported to other countries where they have no ties, she wrote, adding that the termination of Temporary Protection Status for people from Nepal, Honduras, and Nicaragua would result in a $1.4 billion loss to the economy. “The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood,” Thompson said. Lawyers for the National TPS Alliance argued that Noem’s decisions were predetermined by President Donald Trump’s campaign promises and motivated by racial animus. Thompson agreed, saying that statements Noem and Trump have made perpetuated the “discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population.” “Color is neither a poison nor a crime,” she wrote. The advocacy group that filed the lawsuit said designees usually have a year to leave the country, but in this case, they got far less. “They gave them two months to leave the country. It’s awful,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, an attorney for plaintiffs at a hearing Tuesday. Honduras Deputy Foreign Minister Antonio García told The Associated Press, “The judge recognized the need of the (TPS holders) to be able to work in peace, tranquility and legally.” He recalled that during the first Trump administration, there was a similar legal challenge and the fight took five years in the courts. He hoped for a similar outcome this time that would allow the Hondurans to remain in the U.S. “Today’s news is hopeful and positive and gives us time and oxygen, hopefully it will be a long road, and the judge will have the final word and not President Trump,” he said. Meanwhile in Nicaragua, hundreds of thousands have fled into exile as the government shuttered thousands of nongovernmental organizations and imprisoned political opponents. Nicaragua President Daniel Ortega and his wife and co-President Rosario Murillo have consolidated complete control in Nicaragua since Ortega returned to power two decades ago. In February, a panel of U.N. experts warned the Nicaraguan government had dismantled the last remaining checks and balances and was “systematically executing a strategy to cement total control of the country through severe human rights violations.” The broad effort by the Republican administration ’s crackdown on immigration has been going after people who are in the country illegally but also by removing protections that have allowed people to live and work in the U.S. on a temporary basis. The Trump administration has already terminated protections for about 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Some have pending lawsuits at federal courts. The government argued that Noem has clear authority over the program and that her decisions reflect the administration’s objectives in the areas of immigration and foreign policy. “It is not meant to be permanent,” Justice Department attorney William Weiland said. ___ Ding reported from Los Angeles.

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)  Here’s a look at why the aid isn’t being distributed: The U.N. says that longstanding restrictions on the entry of aid have created an unpredictable environment, and that while a pause in fighting might allow more aid in, Palestinians are not confident aid will reach them. “This has resulted in many of our convoys offloaded directly by starving, desperate people as they continue to face deep levels of hunger and are struggling to feed their families,” said Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA. “The only way to reach a level of confidence is by having a sustained flow of aid over a period of time,” she said.

(Planet Labs PBC via AP)  Israel blocked food entirely from entering Gaza for 2 ½ months starting in March. Since it eased the blockade in late May, it allowed in a trickle of aid trucks for the U.N., about 70 a day on average, according to official Israeli figures. That is far below the 500-600 trucks a day that U.N. agencies say are needed — the amount that entered during a six-week ceasefire earlier this year. Much of the aid is stacked up just inside the border in Gaza because U.N. trucks could not pick it up. The U.N says that was because of Israeli military restrictions on its movements and because of the lawlessness in Gaza. Israel has argued that it is allowing sufficient quantities of goods into Gaza and tried to shift the blame to the U.N. “More consistent collection and distribution by U.N. agencies and international organizations = more aid reaching those who need it most in Gaza,” the Israeli military agency in charge of aid coordination, COGAT, said in a statement this week. With the new measures this week, COGAT, says 220-270 truckloads a day were allowed into Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday, and that the U.N. was able to pick up more trucks, reducing some of the backlog at the border.

(AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi, File)   Cherevko said there have been “minor improvements” in approvals by the Israeli military for its movements and some “reduced waiting times” for trucks along the road. But she said the aid missions are “still facing constraints.” Delays of military approval still mean trucks remain idle for long periods, and the military still restricts the routes that the trucks can take onto a single road, which makes it easy for people to know where the trucks are going, U.N officials say. Antoine Renard, who directs the World Food Program’s operations in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, said Wednesday that it took nearly 12 hours to bring in 52 trucks on a 10-kilometer (6 mile) route.

(Planet Labs PBC via AP)  “While we’re doing everything that we can to actually respond to the current wave of starvation in Gaza, the conditions that we have are not sufficient to actually make sure that we can break that wave,” he said. Aid workers say the changes Israel has made in recent days are largely cosmetic. “These are theatrics, token gestures dressed up as progress,” said Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam’s policy lead for Israel and the Palestinian territories. “Of course, a handful of trucks, a few hours of tactical pauses and raining energy bars from the sky is not going to fix irreversible harm done to an entire generation of children that have been starved and malnourished for months now,” she said.

(AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi, File)    As desperation mounts, Palestinians are risking their lives to get food, and violence is increasing, say aid workers. Muhammad Shehada, a political analyst from Gaza who is a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said aid retrieval has turned into the survival of the fittest. “It’s a Darwin dystopia, the strongest survive,” he said. A truck driver said Wednesday that he has driven food supplies four times from the Zikim crossing on Gaza’s northern border. Every time, he said, crowds a kilometer long (0.6 miles) surrounded his truck and took everything on it after he passed the checkpoint at the edge of the Israeli military-controlled border zones. He said some were desperate people, while others were armed. He said that on Tuesday, for the first time, some in the crowd threatened him with knives or small arms. He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing for his safety. Ali al-Derbashi, another truck driver, said that during one trip in July armed men shot the tires, stole everything, including the diesel and batteries and beat him. “If people weren’t starving, they wouldn’t resort to this,” he said. Israel has said it has offered the U.N. armed escorts. The U.N. has refused, saying it can’t be seen to be working with a party to the conflict – and pointing to the reported shootings when Israeli troops are present.

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana, File)    Israel hasn’t given a timeline for how long the measures it implemented this week will continue, heightening uncertainty and urgency among Palestinians to seize the aid before it ends. Palestinians say the way it’s being distributed, including being dropped from the sky, is inhumane. “This approach is inappropriate for Palestinians, we are humiliated,” said Rida, a displaced woman. Momen Abu Etayya said he almost drowned because his son begged him to get aid that fell into the sea during an aid drop. “I threw myself in the ocean to death just to bring him something,” he said. “I was only able to bring him three biscuit packets”. ___ Associated Press reporters Wafaa Shurafa in Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, Fatma Khaled in Cairo and Michael Biesecker in Washington contributed to this report.", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/aid-gaza-starvation-famine-looting-9fc8e7a652c06d9ae505b43e0c399fc8", "published_date": "2025-08-01T16:47:52.847153", "source": "ap", "topic": "climate-change-policy", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:47:52.847162", "word_count": 1355}
{"title": "US envoy arrives in Israel to monitor Gaza food distribution as humanitarian crisis worsens", "content": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Israel on Thursday to discuss the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, as the death toll of Palestinians waiting for food and other aid continued to climb. Witkoff and U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee will inspect food distribution in Gaza on Friday, the White House said. At least 91 Palestinians were killed and more than 600 wounded while attempting to get aid in the past 24 hours, the Gaza Health Ministry said Thursday. The victims included 54 people killed while awaiting food in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing on Wednesday, the ministry said. The toll is expected to rise further as many of those killed or wounded were brought to isolated, undersupplied hospitals in northern Gaza and have not yet been counted. Israel’s military said Palestinians surrounded aid trucks and the Israeli military fired warning shots into the crowd, but reported no awareness of injuries resulting from Israeli fire. A security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations, said the gunfire came from within the crowd and resulted from altercations between Palestinians attempting to access aid.  Scenes of desperation and chaos played out again on Thursday as scores of Palestinians ran toward food aid dropped from the air in Zawaida, a city in central Gaza. Aid providers have turned to the skies as border crossings remain closed amid severe food insecurity across the Gaza Strip. The drops have set off stampedes and skirmishes as hungry crowds scream, fight and jostle for the parcels. Eslam al-Telbany, a displaced woman from Jabaliya, said she was carrying a bottle of cooking oil and a sack of flour when she was attacked and bitten, ultimately dropping the items and returning home without aid. “I went and my children prayed that I’d return with food. They haven’t eaten or drank anything for two days,” she said as she wept. Ahmed al-Khatib said someone stole a bag of flour from him, and he broke a tooth in the struggle. Rana Attia, another displaced woman, said people felt more dignified receiving text messages telling them where to collect aid rather than randomly chasing falling parcels under the scorching heat. “We don’t want them to help us that way,” she said. Despite the airdrops, the amount of aid getting into Gaza remains far lower than the 500 to 600 trucks per day that aid organizations say are needed. The Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating humanitarian aid in Gaza said 270 trucks of aid entered Gaza on Wednesday, and 32 pallets of aid were airdropped into the Strip. Under heavy international pressure, Israel announced a series of measures over the weekend to facilitate the entry of more international aid to Gaza. The international community has heaped criticism on Israel over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. International organizations said that Gaza has been on the brink of famine for the past two years, but that recent developments, including a complete blockade on aid for 2 1/2 months, mean that the “worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in Gaza.” German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul arrived in Israel on Thursday on a two-day trip that will also take him to the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Germany, traditionally a staunch ally of Israel, has been increasingly critical recently of Israel’s actions in Gaza. It has insisted that Israel must do more to increase aid supplies and pushed for a ceasefire. Berlin hasn’t joined major allies France, Britain, and Canada in saying it will recognize a Palestinian state in September. But in a statement ahead of his departure Thursday, Wadephul underlined Germany’s position that a two-state solution is “the only way” to ensure a future in peace and security for people on both sides. “For Germany, the recognition of a Palestinian state stands rather at the end of the process. But such a process must begin now. Germany will not move from this aim,” Wadephul said. Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, arrived in Israel on Thursday afternoon and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the humanitarian situation and a possible ceasefire, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. It was the first meeting between Witkoff and Netanyahu since both Israel and the U.S. called their negotiation teams home from Qatar one week ago. Witkoff said at the time that Hamas “shows a lack of desire” to reach a truce. “The fastest way to end the Humanitarian Crises in Gaza is for Hamas to SURRENDER AND RELEASE THE HOSTAGES!!!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Thursday morning. Trump sent Witkoff to the region “in an effort to save lives and end this crisis,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, calling the president “a humanitarian with a big heart.” The war started when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 251 others. They still hold 50 hostages, including around 20 believed to be alive. Most of the others have been released in ceasefires or other deals. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 60,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Its count doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians. The ministry operates under the Hamas government. The U.N. and other international organizations see it as the most reliable source of data on casualties. ___ Fatma Khaled in Cairo, Sam Metz in Jerusalem and Imad Isseid in Ramallah, West Bank, contributed to this report.", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-gaza-war-news-07-31-2025-d9d578ecf303c0f4e8b14074eb980101", "published_date": "2025-08-01T16:47:54.079552", "source": "ap", "topic": "climate-change-policy", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:47:54.079561", "word_count": 918}
{"title": "Virginia Giuffre’s family expresses shock over Trump saying Epstein ‘stole’ her", "content": "▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration The family of Virginia Giuffre, who was among Jeffrey Epstein’s most well-known sex trafficking accusers, said that it was shocking to hear President Donald Trump say the disgraced financier “stole” Giuffre from him and urged that Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, remain in prison. Giuffre, who had accused Britain’s Prince Andrew and other influential men of sexually exploiting her as a teenager trafficked by Epstein, has been a central figure in conspiracy theories tied to the case. She died by suicide this year. Her family’s statement is the latest development involving Epstein, who took his own life in a New York jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges, and the Republican president, who was his one-time friend. Trump denied prior knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and said he cut off their relationship years ago, but he still faces questions about the case. President Donald Trump said Thursday he “didn’t know” why disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein “stole” young women, including Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, from his Mar-a-Lago spa decades ago but he said he “didn’t like it and we threw him out.” Trump, responding to a reporter’s question on Tuesday, said that he got upset with Epstein over his poaching of workers and that Epstein had stolen Giuffre from his Palm Beach, Florida, club. “It was shocking to hear President Trump invoke our sister and say that he was aware that Virginia had been ‘stolen’ from Mar-a-Lago,” the family’s statement said. “We and the public are asking for answers; survivors deserve this,” it continued. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt noted the president was responding to a reporter’s question and didn’t bring up Giuffre himself.  “The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club for being a creep to his female employees,” she said. The family’s statement comes shortly after the Justice Department interviewed Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 on sex trafficking and other charges and is serving a 20-year sentence in Tallahassee, Florida. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche interviewed Maxwell in a Florida courthouse, though details about what she said haven’t become public. Maxwell’s lawyers have said she testified truthfully and answered questions “about 100 different people.” They have said she’s willing to answer more questions from Congress if she is granted immunity from future prosecution for her testimony and if lawmakers agree to satisfy other conditions. A message seeking comment about the Giuffre family’s statement was sent to Maxwell’s attorney on Thursday. In a CNN interview Thursday evening, Giuffre’s family also spoke out.

(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File)  “She wasn’t stolen, she was preyed upon at his property, at President Trump’s property … stolen seems very impersonal. It feels very much like an object, and the survivors are not objects, women are not objects,” said Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother. “She was preyed upon, and it certainly makes you kind of ask the question, you know, how much he knew during that time?” A Trump administration official said the president is not currently considering clemency action for Maxwell. Giuffre said she was approached by Maxwell in 2000 and eventually was hired by her as a masseuse for Epstein. But the couple effectively made her a sexual servant, she said, pressuring her into gratifying not only Epstein but his friends and associates. Giuffre said she was flown around the world for appointments with men including Prince Andrew while she was 17 and 18 years old. The men, including Andrew, denied it and assailed Giuffre’s credibility. She acknowledged changing some key details of her account. The prince settled with Giuffre in 2022 for an undisclosed sum, agreeing to make a “substantial donation” to her survivors’ organization. The American-born Giuffre lived in Australia for years and became an advocate for sex trafficking survivors after emerging as a central figure in Epstein’s prolonged downfall.

{"title": "Judge blocks Trump administration from ending protections for 60,000 from Central America and Nepal", "content": "▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday against the Trump administration’s plans and extended Temporary Protected Status for 60,000 people from Central America and Asia, including people from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua. Temporary Protected Status is a protection that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people of various nationalities who are in the United States, preventing from being deported and allowing them to work. The Trump administration has aggressively been seeking to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal. It’s part of a wider effort by the administration to carry out mass deportations of immigrants. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem can extend Temporary Protected Status to immigrants in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe to return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions. Noem had ruled to end protections for tens of thousands of Hondurans and Nicaraguans after determining that conditions in their homelands no longer warranted them. The secretary said the two countries had made “significant progress” in recovering from 1998’s Hurricane Mitch, one of the deadliest Atlantic storms in history. The designation for an estimated 7,000 from Nepal was scheduled to end Aug. 5 while protections allowing 51,000 Hondurans and nearly 3,000 Nicaraguans who have been in the U.S. for more than 25 years were set to expire Sept. 8. ◆ Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson in San Francisco did not set an expiration date but rather ruled to keep the protections in place while the case proceeds. The next hearing is Nov. 18.  In a sharply written order, Thompson said the administration ended the migrant status protections without an “objective review of the country conditions” such as political violence in Honduras and the impact of recent hurricanes and storms in Nicaragua. If the protections were not extended, immigrants could suffer from loss of employment, health insurance, be separated from their families, and risk being deported to other countries where they have no ties, she wrote, adding that the termination of Temporary Protection Status for people from Nepal, Honduras, and Nicaragua would result in a $1.4 billion loss to the economy. “The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood,” Thompson said. Lawyers for the National TPS Alliance argued that Noem’s decisions were predetermined by President Donald Trump’s campaign promises and motivated by racial animus. Thompson agreed, saying that statements Noem and Trump have made perpetuated the “discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population.” “Color is neither a poison nor a crime,” she wrote. The advocacy group that filed the lawsuit said designees usually have a year to leave the country, but in this case, they got far less. “They gave them two months to leave the country. It’s awful,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, an attorney for plaintiffs at a hearing Tuesday. Honduras Deputy Foreign Minister Antonio García told The Associated Press, “The judge recognized the need of the (TPS holders) to be able to work in peace, tranquility and legally.” He recalled that during the first Trump administration, there was a similar legal challenge and the fight took five years in the courts. He hoped for a similar outcome this time that would allow the Hondurans to remain in the U.S. “Today’s news is hopeful and positive and gives us time and oxygen, hopefully it will be a long road, and the judge will have the final word and not President Trump,” he said. Meanwhile in Nicaragua, hundreds of thousands have fled into exile as the government shuttered thousands of nongovernmental organizations and imprisoned political opponents. Nicaragua President Daniel Ortega and his wife and co-President Rosario Murillo have consolidated complete control in Nicaragua since Ortega returned to power two decades ago. In February, a panel of U.N. experts warned the Nicaraguan government had dismantled the last remaining checks and balances and was “systematically executing a strategy to cement total control of the country through severe human rights violations.” The broad effort by the Republican administration ’s crackdown on immigration has been going after people who are in the country illegally but also by removing protections that have allowed people to live and work in the U.S. on a temporary basis. The Trump administration has already terminated protections for about 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Some have pending lawsuits at federal courts. The government argued that Noem has clear authority over the program and that her decisions reflect the administration’s objectives in the areas of immigration and foreign policy. “It is not meant to be permanent,” Justice Department attorney William Weiland said. ___ Ding reported from Los Angeles.

{"title": "El Salvador approves indefinite presidential reelection and extends terms to 6 years", "content": "▶ Lee esta historia en español SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — The party of El Salvador President Nayib Bukele approved constitutional changes in the country’s Legislative Assembly on Thursday that will allow indefinite presidential reelection and extend presidential terms to six years. Lawmaker Ana Figueroa from the New Ideas party had proposed the changes to five articles of the constitution. The proposal also included eliminating the second round of the election where the two top vote-getters from the first round face off. New Ideas and its allies in the Legislative Assembly quickly approved the proposals with the supermajority they hold. The vote passed with 57 in favor and three opposed. Bukele overwhelmingly won reelection last year despite a constitutional ban, after Supreme Court justices selected by his party ruled in 2021 to allow reelection to a second five-year term. Observers have worried that Bukele had a plan to consolidate power since at least 2021, when a newly elected Congress with a strong governing party majority voted to remove the magistrates of the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court. Those justices had been seen as the last check on the popular president. Since then, Bukele has only grown more popular. The Biden administration’s initial expressions of concern gave way to quiet acceptance as Bukele announced his run for reelection. With the return of U.S. President Donald Trump to the White House in January, Bukele had a new powerful ally and quickly offered Trump help by taking more than 200 deportees from other countries into a newly built prison for gang members.  Figueroa argued Thursday that federal lawmakers and mayors can already seek reelection as many times as they want. “All of them have had the possibility of reelection through popular vote, the only exception until now has been the presidency,” Figueroa said. She also proposed that Bukele’s current term, scheduled to end June 1, 2029, instead finish June 1, 2027, to put presidential and congressional elections on the same schedule. It would also allow Bukele to seek reelection to a longer term two years earlier. Marcela Villatoro of the Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena), one of three votes against the proposals, told her fellow lawmakers that “Democracy in El Salvador has died!” “You don’t realize what indefinite reelection brings: It brings an accumulation of power and weakens democracy ... there’s corruption and clientelism because nepotism grows and halts democracy and political participation,” she said. Suecy Callejas, the assembly’s vice president, said that “power has returned to the only place that it truly belongs ... to the Salvadoran people.” Bukele did not immediately comment. Bukele, who once dubbed himself “the world’s coolest dictator,” is highly popular, largely because of his heavy-handed fight against the country’s powerful street gangs. Voters have been willing to overlook evidence that his administration like others before it had negotiated with the gangs, before seeking a state of emergency that suspended some constitutional rights and allowed authorities to arrest and jail tens of thousands of people. His success with security and politically has inspired imitators in the region who seek to replicate his style. Most recently, Bukele’s government has faced international criticism for the arrests of high-profile lawyers who have been outspoken critics of his administration. One of the country’s most prominent human rights group announced in July it was moving its operations out of El Salvador for the safety of its people, accusing the government of a “wave of repression.”", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/el-salvador-nayib-bukele-reelection-f9efd1a08d3c9de2f886f7b911b9417d", "published_date": "2025-08-01T16:47:57.734644", "source": "ap", "topic": "economic-inflation", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:47:57.734651", "word_count": 573}
{"title": "Why not enough food is reaching people in Gaza even after Israel eased its blockade", "content": "International outcry over images of emaciated children and increasing reports of hunger-related deaths have pressured Israel to let more aid into the Gaza Strip. This week, Israel paused fighting in parts of Gaza and airdropped food.  But aid groups and Palestinians say the changes have only been incremental and are not enough to reverse what food experts say is a “ worst-case scenario of famine” unfolding in the war-ravaged territory. The new measures have brought an uptick in the number of aid trucks entering Gaza. But almost none of it reaches U.N. warehouses for distribution. Instead, nearly all the trucks are stripped of their cargo by crowds that overwhelm them on the roads as they drive from the borders. The crowds are a mix of Palestinians desperate for food and gangs armed with knives, axes or pistols who loot the goods to then hoard or sell. Many have also been killed trying to grab the aid. Witnesses say Israeli troops often open fire on crowds around the aid trucks, and hospitals have reported hundreds killed or wounded. The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots to control crowds or at people who approach its forces. The alternative food distribution system run by the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has also been marred by violence. International airdrops of aid have resumed. But aid groups say airdrops deliver only a fraction of what trucks can supply. Also, many parcels have landed in now-inaccessible areas that Palestinians have been told to evacuate, while others have plunged into the Mediterranean Sea, forcing people to swim out to retrieve drenched bags of flour.

Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA. “The only way to reach a level of confidence is by having a sustained flow of aid over a period of time,” she said.

Since it eased the blockade in late May, it allowed in a trickle of aid trucks for the U.N., about 70 a day on average, according to official Israeli figures. That is far below the 500-600 trucks a day that U.N. agencies say are needed — the amount that entered during a six-week ceasefire earlier this year. Much of the aid is stacked up just inside the border in Gaza because U.N. trucks could not pick it up. The U.N says that was because of Israeli military restrictions on its movements and because of the lawlessness in Gaza.

With the new measures this week, COGAT, says 220-270 truckloads a day were allowed into Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday, and that the U.N. was able to pick up more trucks, reducing some of the backlog at the border.

He said some were desperate people, while others were armed. He said that on Tuesday, for the first time, some in the crowd threatened him with knives or small arms. He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing for his safety. Ali al-Derbashi, another truck driver, said that during one trip in July armed men shot the tires, stole everything, including the diesel and batteries and beat him. “If people weren’t starving, they wouldn’t resort to this,” he said.

{"title": "US envoy arrives in Israel to monitor Gaza food distribution as humanitarian crisis worsens", "content": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Israel on Thursday to discuss the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, as the death toll of Palestinians waiting for food and other aid continued to climb. Witkoff and U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee will inspect food distribution in Gaza on Friday, the White House said. At least 91 Palestinians were killed and more than 600 wounded while attempting to get aid in the past 24 hours, the Gaza Health Ministry said Thursday. The victims included 54 people killed while awaiting food in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing on Wednesday, the ministry said. The toll is expected to rise further as many of those killed or wounded were brought to isolated, undersupplied hospitals in northern Gaza and have not yet been counted. Israel’s military said Palestinians surrounded aid trucks and the Israeli military fired warning shots into the crowd, but reported no awareness of injuries resulting from Israeli fire. A security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations, said the gunfire came from within the crowd and resulted from altercations between Palestinians attempting to access aid.  Scenes of desperation and chaos played out again on Thursday as scores of Palestinians ran toward food aid dropped from the air in Zawaida, a city in central Gaza. Aid providers have turned to the skies as border crossings remain closed amid severe food insecurity across the Gaza Strip. The drops have set off stampedes and skirmishes as hungry crowds scream, fight and jostle for the parcels. Eslam al-Telbany, a displaced woman from Jabaliya, said she was carrying a bottle of cooking oil and a sack of flour when she was attacked and bitten, ultimately dropping the items and returning home without aid. “I went and my children prayed that I’d return with food. They haven’t eaten or drank anything for two days,” she said as she wept. Ahmed al-Khatib said someone stole a bag of flour from him, and he broke a tooth in the struggle. Rana Attia, another displaced woman, said people felt more dignified receiving text messages telling them where to collect aid rather than randomly chasing falling parcels under the scorching heat. “We don’t want them to help us that way,” she said. Despite the airdrops, the amount of aid getting into Gaza remains far lower than the 500 to 600 trucks per day that aid organizations say are needed. The Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating humanitarian aid in Gaza said 270 trucks of aid entered Gaza on Wednesday, and 32 pallets of aid were airdropped into the Strip. Under heavy international pressure, Israel announced a series of measures over the weekend to facilitate the entry of more international aid to Gaza. The international community has heaped criticism on Israel over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. International organizations said that Gaza has been on the brink of famine for the past two years, but that recent developments, including a complete blockade on aid for 2 1/2 months, mean that the “worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in Gaza.” German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul arrived in Israel on Thursday on a two-day trip that will also take him to the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Germany, traditionally a staunch ally of Israel, has been increasingly critical recently of Israel’s actions in Gaza. It has insisted that Israel must do more to increase aid supplies and pushed for a ceasefire. Berlin hasn’t joined major allies France, Britain, and Canada in saying it will recognize a Palestinian state in September. But in a statement ahead of his departure Thursday, Wadephul underlined Germany’s position that a two-state solution is “the only way” to ensure a future in peace and security for people on both sides. “For Germany, the recognition of a Palestinian state stands rather at the end of the process. But such a process must begin now. Germany will not move from this aim,” Wadephul said. Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, arrived in Israel on Thursday afternoon and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the humanitarian situation and a possible ceasefire, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. It was the first meeting between Witkoff and Netanyahu since both Israel and the U.S. called their negotiation teams home from Qatar one week ago. Witkoff said at the time that Hamas “shows a lack of desire” to reach a truce. “The fastest way to end the Humanitarian Crises in Gaza is for Hamas to SURRENDER AND RELEASE THE HOSTAGES!!!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Thursday morning. Trump sent Witkoff to the region “in an effort to save lives and end this crisis,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, calling the president “a humanitarian with a big heart.” The war started when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 251 others. They still hold 50 hostages, including around 20 believed to be alive. Most of the others have been released in ceasefires or other deals. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 60,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Its count doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians. The ministry operates under the Hamas government. The U.N. and other international organizations see it as the most reliable source of data on casualties. ___ Fatma Khaled in Cairo, Sam Metz in Jerusalem and Imad Isseid in Ramallah, West Bank, contributed to this report.", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-gaza-war-news-07-31-2025-d9d578ecf303c0f4e8b14074eb980101", "published_date": "2025-08-01T16:48:00.134984", "source": "ap", "topic": "economic-inflation", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:00.134991", "word_count": 918}
{"title": "Virginia Giuffre’s family expresses shock over Trump saying Epstein ‘stole’ her", "content": "▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration The family of Virginia Giuffre, who was among Jeffrey Epstein’s most well-known sex trafficking accusers, said that it was shocking to hear President Donald Trump say the disgraced financier “stole” Giuffre from him and urged that Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, remain in prison. Giuffre, who had accused Britain’s Prince Andrew and other influential men of sexually exploiting her as a teenager trafficked by Epstein, has been a central figure in conspiracy theories tied to the case. She died by suicide this year. Her family’s statement is the latest development involving Epstein, who took his own life in a New York jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges, and the Republican president, who was his one-time friend. Trump denied prior knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and said he cut off their relationship years ago, but he still faces questions about the case. President Donald Trump said Thursday he “didn’t know” why disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein “stole” young women, including Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, from his Mar-a-Lago spa decades ago but he said he “didn’t like it and we threw him out.” Trump, responding to a reporter’s question on Tuesday, said that he got upset with Epstein over his poaching of workers and that Epstein had stolen Giuffre from his Palm Beach, Florida, club. “It was shocking to hear President Trump invoke our sister and say that he was aware that Virginia had been ‘stolen’ from Mar-a-Lago,” the family’s statement said. “We and the public are asking for answers; survivors deserve this,” it continued. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt noted the president was responding to a reporter’s question and didn’t bring up Giuffre himself.  “The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club for being a creep to his female employees,” she said. The family’s statement comes shortly after the Justice Department interviewed Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 on sex trafficking and other charges and is serving a 20-year sentence in Tallahassee, Florida. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche interviewed Maxwell in a Florida courthouse, though details about what she said haven’t become public. Maxwell’s lawyers have said she testified truthfully and answered questions “about 100 different people.” They have said she’s willing to answer more questions from Congress if she is granted immunity from future prosecution for her testimony and if lawmakers agree to satisfy other conditions. A message seeking comment about the Giuffre family’s statement was sent to Maxwell’s attorney on Thursday. In a CNN interview Thursday evening, Giuffre’s family also spoke out.

(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File)  “She wasn’t stolen, she was preyed upon at his property, at President Trump’s property … stolen seems very impersonal. It feels very much like an object, and the survivors are not objects, women are not objects,” said Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother. “She was preyed upon, and it certainly makes you kind of ask the question, you know, how much he knew during that time?” A Trump administration official said the president is not currently considering clemency action for Maxwell. Giuffre said she was approached by Maxwell in 2000 and eventually was hired by her as a masseuse for Epstein. But the couple effectively made her a sexual servant, she said, pressuring her into gratifying not only Epstein but his friends and associates. Giuffre said she was flown around the world for appointments with men including Prince Andrew while she was 17 and 18 years old. The men, including Andrew, denied it and assailed Giuffre’s credibility. She acknowledged changing some key details of her account. The prince settled with Giuffre in 2022 for an undisclosed sum, agreeing to make a “substantial donation” to her survivors’ organization. The American-born Giuffre lived in Australia for years and became an advocate for sex trafficking survivors after emerging as a central figure in Epstein’s prolonged downfall. Her family’s statement said she endured death threats and financial ruin over her cooperation with authorities against Epstein and Maxwell.", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/epstein-trump-maxwell-giuffre-stole-family-40d4318c2ab7987e93a4fc8484464ec8", "published_date": "2025-08-01T16:48:01.279331", "source": "ap", "topic": "economic-inflation", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:01.279338", "word_count": 704}
{"title": "Judge blocks Trump administration from ending protections for 60,000 from Central America and Nepal", "content": "▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday against the Trump administration’s plans and extended Temporary Protected Status for 60,000 people from Central America and Asia, including people from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua. Temporary Protected Status is a protection that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people of various nationalities who are in the United States, preventing from being deported and allowing them to work. The Trump administration has aggressively been seeking to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal. It’s part of a wider effort by the administration to carry out mass deportations of immigrants. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem can extend Temporary Protected Status to immigrants in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe to return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions. Noem had ruled to end protections for tens of thousands of Hondurans and Nicaraguans after determining that conditions in their homelands no longer warranted them. The secretary said the two countries had made “significant progress” in recovering from 1998’s Hurricane Mitch, one of the deadliest Atlantic storms in history. The designation for an estimated 7,000 from Nepal was scheduled to end Aug. 5 while protections allowing 51,000 Hondurans and nearly 3,000 Nicaraguans who have been in the U.S. for more than 25 years were set to expire Sept. 8. ◆ Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson in San Francisco did not set an expiration date but rather ruled to keep the protections in place while the case proceeds. The next hearing is Nov. 18.  In a sharply written order, Thompson said the administration ended the migrant status protections without an “objective review of the country conditions” such as political violence in Honduras and the impact of recent hurricanes and storms in Nicaragua. If the protections were not extended, immigrants could suffer from loss of employment, health insurance, be separated from their families, and risk being deported to other countries where they have no ties, she wrote, adding that the termination of Temporary Protection Status for people from Nepal, Honduras, and Nicaragua would result in a $1.4 billion loss to the economy. “The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood,” Thompson said. Lawyers for the National TPS Alliance argued that Noem’s decisions were predetermined by President Donald Trump’s campaign promises and motivated by racial animus. Thompson agreed, saying that statements Noem and Trump have made perpetuated the “discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population.” “Color is neither a poison nor a crime,” she wrote. The advocacy group that filed the lawsuit said designees usually have a year to leave the country, but in this case, they got far less. “They gave them two months to leave the country. It’s awful,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, an attorney for plaintiffs at a hearing Tuesday. Honduras Deputy Foreign Minister Antonio García told The Associated Press, “The judge recognized the need of the (TPS holders) to be able to work in peace, tranquility and legally.” He recalled that during the first Trump administration, there was a similar legal challenge and the fight took five years in the courts. He hoped for a similar outcome this time that would allow the Hondurans to remain in the U.S. “Today’s news is hopeful and positive and gives us time and oxygen, hopefully it will be a long road, and the judge will have the final word and not President Trump,” he said. Meanwhile in Nicaragua, hundreds of thousands have fled into exile as the government shuttered thousands of nongovernmental organizations and imprisoned political opponents. Nicaragua President Daniel Ortega and his wife and co-President Rosario Murillo have consolidated complete control in Nicaragua since Ortega returned to power two decades ago. In February, a panel of U.N. experts warned the Nicaraguan government had dismantled the last remaining checks and balances and was “systematically executing a strategy to cement total control of the country through severe human rights violations.” The broad effort by the Republican administration ’s crackdown on immigration has been going after people who are in the country illegally but also by removing protections that have allowed people to live and work in the U.S. on a temporary basis. The Trump administration has already terminated protections for about 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Some have pending lawsuits at federal courts. The government argued that Noem has clear authority over the program and that her decisions reflect the administration’s objectives in the areas of immigration and foreign policy. “It is not meant to be permanent,” Justice Department attorney William Weiland said. ___ Ding reported from Los Angeles.

{"title": "El Salvador approves indefinite presidential reelection and extends terms to 6 years", "content": "▶ Lee esta historia en español SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — The party of El Salvador President Nayib Bukele approved constitutional changes in the country’s Legislative Assembly on Thursday that will allow indefinite presidential reelection and extend presidential terms to six years. Lawmaker Ana Figueroa from the New Ideas party had proposed the changes to five articles of the constitution. The proposal also included eliminating the second round of the election where the two top vote-getters from the first round face off. New Ideas and its allies in the Legislative Assembly quickly approved the proposals with the supermajority they hold. The vote passed with 57 in favor and three opposed. Bukele overwhelmingly won reelection last year despite a constitutional ban, after Supreme Court justices selected by his party ruled in 2021 to allow reelection to a second five-year term. Observers have worried that Bukele had a plan to consolidate power since at least 2021, when a newly elected Congress with a strong governing party majority voted to remove the magistrates of the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court. Those justices had been seen as the last check on the popular president. Since then, Bukele has only grown more popular. The Biden administration’s initial expressions of concern gave way to quiet acceptance as Bukele announced his run for reelection. With the return of U.S. President Donald Trump to the White House in January, Bukele had a new powerful ally and quickly offered Trump help by taking more than 200 deportees from other countries into a newly built prison for gang members.  Figueroa argued Thursday that federal lawmakers and mayors can already seek reelection as many times as they want. “All of them have had the possibility of reelection through popular vote, the only exception until now has been the presidency,” Figueroa said. She also proposed that Bukele’s current term, scheduled to end June 1, 2029, instead finish June 1, 2027, to put presidential and congressional elections on the same schedule. It would also allow Bukele to seek reelection to a longer term two years earlier. Marcela Villatoro of the Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena), one of three votes against the proposals, told her fellow lawmakers that “Democracy in El Salvador has died!” “You don’t realize what indefinite reelection brings: It brings an accumulation of power and weakens democracy ... there’s corruption and clientelism because nepotism grows and halts democracy and political participation,” she said. Suecy Callejas, the assembly’s vice president, said that “power has returned to the only place that it truly belongs ... to the Salvadoran people.” Bukele did not immediately comment. Bukele, who once dubbed himself “the world’s coolest dictator,” is highly popular, largely because of his heavy-handed fight against the country’s powerful street gangs. Voters have been willing to overlook evidence that his administration like others before it had negotiated with the gangs, before seeking a state of emergency that suspended some constitutional rights and allowed authorities to arrest and jail tens of thousands of people. His success with security and politically has inspired imitators in the region who seek to replicate his style. Most recently, Bukele’s government has faced international criticism for the arrests of high-profile lawyers who have been outspoken critics of his administration. One of the country’s most prominent human rights group announced in July it was moving its operations out of El Salvador for the safety of its people, accusing the government of a “wave of repression.”", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/el-salvador-nayib-bukele-reelection-f9efd1a08d3c9de2f886f7b911b9417d", "published_date": "2025-08-01T16:48:03.807255", "source": "ap", "topic": "immigration-policy", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:03.807263", "word_count": 573}
{"title": "Why not enough food is reaching people in Gaza even after Israel eased its blockade", "content": "International outcry over images of emaciated children and increasing reports of hunger-related deaths have pressured Israel to let more aid into the Gaza Strip. This week, Israel paused fighting in parts of Gaza and airdropped food.  But aid groups and Palestinians say the changes have only been incremental and are not enough to reverse what food experts say is a “ worst-case scenario of famine” unfolding in the war-ravaged territory. The new measures have brought an uptick in the number of aid trucks entering Gaza. But almost none of it reaches U.N. warehouses for distribution. Instead, nearly all the trucks are stripped of their cargo by crowds that overwhelm them on the roads as they drive from the borders. The crowds are a mix of Palestinians desperate for food and gangs armed with knives, axes or pistols who loot the goods to then hoard or sell. Many have also been killed trying to grab the aid. Witnesses say Israeli troops often open fire on crowds around the aid trucks, and hospitals have reported hundreds killed or wounded. The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots to control crowds or at people who approach its forces. The alternative food distribution system run by the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has also been marred by violence. International airdrops of aid have resumed. But aid groups say airdrops deliver only a fraction of what trucks can supply. Also, many parcels have landed in now-inaccessible areas that Palestinians have been told to evacuate, while others have plunged into the Mediterranean Sea, forcing people to swim out to retrieve drenched bags of flour.  Palestinians struggle to get donated food at a community kitchen, in Gaza City, northern Gaza Strip, Saturday, July 26, 2025. (AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)  Here’s a look at why the aid isn’t being distributed: The U.N. says that longstanding restrictions on the entry of aid have created an unpredictable environment, and that while a pause in fighting might allow more aid in, Palestinians are not confident aid will reach them. “This has resulted in many of our convoys offloaded directly by starving, desperate people as they continue to face deep levels of hunger and are struggling to feed their families,” said Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA. “The only way to reach a level of confidence is by having a sustained flow of aid over a period of time,” she said. This satellite image provided by Planet Labs PBC shows crowds of people in Gaza surrounding an aid convoy in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, on July 26, 2025. (Planet Labs PBC via AP)  Israel blocked food entirely from entering Gaza for 2 ½ months starting in March. Since it eased the blockade in late May, it allowed in a trickle of aid trucks for the U.N., about 70 a day on average, according to official Israeli figures. That is far below the 500-600 trucks a day that U.N. agencies say are needed — the amount that entered during a six-week ceasefire earlier this year. Much of the aid is stacked up just inside the border in Gaza because U.N. trucks could not pick it up. The U.N says that was because of Israeli military restrictions on its movements and because of the lawlessness in Gaza. Israel has argued that it is allowing sufficient quantities of goods into Gaza and tried to shift the blame to the U.N. “More consistent collection and distribution by U.N. agencies and international organizations = more aid reaching those who need it most in Gaza,” the Israeli military agency in charge of aid coordination, COGAT, said in a statement this week. With the new measures this week, COGAT, says 220-270 truckloads a day were allowed into Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday, and that the U.N. was able to pick up more trucks, reducing some of the backlog at the border. Palestinians hold onto an aid truck returning to Gaza City on Tuesday, July 22, 2025. (AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi, File)   Cherevko said there have been “minor improvements” in approvals by the Israeli military for its movements and some “reduced waiting times” for trucks along the road. But she said the aid missions are “still facing constraints.” Delays of military approval still mean trucks remain idle for long periods, and the military still restricts the routes that the trucks can take onto a single road, which makes it easy for people to know where the trucks are going, U.N officials say. Antoine Renard, who directs the World Food Program’s operations in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, said Wednesday that it took nearly 12 hours to bring in 52 trucks on a 10-kilometer (6 mile) route.

(Planet Labs PBC via AP)  “While we’re doing everything that we can to actually respond to the current wave of starvation in Gaza, the conditions that we have are not sufficient to actually make sure that we can break that wave,” he said. Aid workers say the changes Israel has made in recent days are largely cosmetic. “These are theatrics, token gestures dressed up as progress,” said Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam’s policy lead for Israel and the Palestinian territories. “Of course, a handful of trucks, a few hours of tactical pauses and raining energy bars from the sky is not going to fix irreversible harm done to an entire generation of children that have been starved and malnourished for months now,” she said. Palestinians carry humanitarian aid from a World Food Program convoy that was heading to Gaza City, June 16, 2025. (AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi, File)    As desperation mounts, Palestinians are risking their lives to get food, and violence is increasing, say aid workers. Muhammad Shehada, a political analyst from Gaza who is a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said aid retrieval has turned into the survival of the fittest. “It’s a Darwin dystopia, the strongest survive,” he said. A truck driver said Wednesday that he has driven food supplies four times from the Zikim crossing on Gaza’s northern border. Every time, he said, crowds a kilometer long (0.6 miles) surrounded his truck and took everything on it after he passed the checkpoint at the edge of the Israeli military-controlled border zones. He said some were desperate people, while others were armed. He said that on Tuesday, for the first time, some in the crowd threatened him with knives or small arms. He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing for his safety. Ali al-Derbashi, another truck driver, said that during one trip in July armed men shot the tires, stole everything, including the diesel and batteries and beat him. “If people weren’t starving, they wouldn’t resort to this,” he said. Israel has said it has offered the U.N. armed escorts. The U.N. has refused, saying it can’t be seen to be working with a party to the conflict – and pointing to the reported shootings when Israeli troops are present.

Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, arrived in Israel on Thursday afternoon and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the humanitarian situation and a possible ceasefire, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. It was the first meeting between Witkoff and Netanyahu since both Israel and the U.S. called their negotiation teams home from Qatar one week ago. Witkoff said at the time that Hamas “shows a lack of desire” to reach a truce. “The fastest way to end the Humanitarian Crises in Gaza is for Hamas to SURRENDER AND RELEASE THE HOSTAGES!!!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Thursday morning. Trump sent Witkoff to the region “in an effort to save lives and end this crisis,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, calling the president “a humanitarian with a big heart.” The war started when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 251 others. They still hold 50 hostages, including around 20 believed to be alive. Most of the others have been released in ceasefires or other deals. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 60,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Its count doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians. The ministry operates under the Hamas government. The U.N. and other international organizations see it as the most reliable source of data on casualties. ___ Fatma Khaled in Cairo, Sam Metz in Jerusalem and Imad Isseid in Ramallah, West Bank, contributed to this report.", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-gaza-war-news-07-31-2025-d9d578ecf303c0f4e8b14074eb980101", "published_date": "2025-08-01T16:48:06.231488", "source": "ap", "topic": "immigration-policy", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:06.231497", "word_count": 918}
{"title": "Virginia Giuffre’s family expresses shock over Trump saying Epstein ‘stole’ her", "content": "▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration The family of Virginia Giuffre, who was among Jeffrey Epstein’s most well-known sex trafficking accusers, said that it was shocking to hear President Donald Trump say the disgraced financier “stole” Giuffre from him and urged that Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, remain in prison. Giuffre, who had accused Britain’s Prince Andrew and other influential men of sexually exploiting her as a teenager trafficked by Epstein, has been a central figure in conspiracy theories tied to the case. She died by suicide this year. Her family’s statement is the latest development involving Epstein, who took his own life in a New York jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges, and the Republican president, who was his one-time friend. Trump denied prior knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and said he cut off their relationship years ago, but he still faces questions about the case. President Donald Trump said Thursday he “didn’t know” why disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein “stole” young women, including Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, from his Mar-a-Lago spa decades ago but he said he “didn’t like it and we threw him out.” Trump, responding to a reporter’s question on Tuesday, said that he got upset with Epstein over his poaching of workers and that Epstein had stolen Giuffre from his Palm Beach, Florida, club. “It was shocking to hear President Trump invoke our sister and say that he was aware that Virginia had been ‘stolen’ from Mar-a-Lago,” the family’s statement said. “We and the public are asking for answers; survivors deserve this,” it continued. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt noted the president was responding to a reporter’s question and didn’t bring up Giuffre himself.  “The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club for being a creep to his female employees,” she said. The family’s statement comes shortly after the Justice Department interviewed Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 on sex trafficking and other charges and is serving a 20-year sentence in Tallahassee, Florida. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche interviewed Maxwell in a Florida courthouse, though details about what she said haven’t become public. Maxwell’s lawyers have said she testified truthfully and answered questions “about 100 different people.” They have said she’s willing to answer more questions from Congress if she is granted immunity from future prosecution for her testimony and if lawmakers agree to satisfy other conditions. A message seeking comment about the Giuffre family’s statement was sent to Maxwell’s attorney on Thursday. In a CNN interview Thursday evening, Giuffre’s family also spoke out.

(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File)  “She wasn’t stolen, she was preyed upon at his property, at President Trump’s property … stolen seems very impersonal. It feels very much like an object, and the survivors are not objects, women are not objects,” said Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother. “She was preyed upon, and it certainly makes you kind of ask the question, you know, how much he knew during that time?” A Trump administration official said the president is not currently considering clemency action for Maxwell. Giuffre said she was approached by Maxwell in 2000 and eventually was hired by her as a masseuse for Epstein. But the couple effectively made her a sexual servant, she said, pressuring her into gratifying not only Epstein but his friends and associates. Giuffre said she was flown around the world for appointments with men including Prince Andrew while she was 17 and 18 years old. The men, including Andrew, denied it and assailed Giuffre’s credibility. She acknowledged changing some key details of her account. The prince settled with Giuffre in 2022 for an undisclosed sum, agreeing to make a “substantial donation” to her survivors’ organization. The American-born Giuffre lived in Australia for years and became an advocate for sex trafficking survivors after emerging as a central figure in Epstein’s prolonged downfall.

{"title": "Judge blocks Trump administration from ending protections for 60,000 from Central America and Nepal", "content": "▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday against the Trump administration’s plans and extended Temporary Protected Status for 60,000 people from Central America and Asia, including people from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua. Temporary Protected Status is a protection that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people of various nationalities who are in the United States, preventing from being deported and allowing them to work. The Trump administration has aggressively been seeking to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal. It’s part of a wider effort by the administration to carry out mass deportations of immigrants. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem can extend Temporary Protected Status to immigrants in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe to return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions. Noem had ruled to end protections for tens of thousands of Hondurans and Nicaraguans after determining that conditions in their homelands no longer warranted them. The secretary said the two countries had made “significant progress” in recovering from 1998’s Hurricane Mitch, one of the deadliest Atlantic storms in history. The designation for an estimated 7,000 from Nepal was scheduled to end Aug. 5 while protections allowing 51,000 Hondurans and nearly 3,000 Nicaraguans who have been in the U.S. for more than 25 years were set to expire Sept. 8. ◆ Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson in San Francisco did not set an expiration date but rather ruled to keep the protections in place while the case proceeds. The next hearing is Nov. 18.  In a sharply written order, Thompson said the administration ended the migrant status protections without an “objective review of the country conditions” such as political violence in Honduras and the impact of recent hurricanes and storms in Nicaragua. If the protections were not extended, immigrants could suffer from loss of employment, health insurance, be separated from their families, and risk being deported to other countries where they have no ties, she wrote, adding that the termination of Temporary Protection Status for people from Nepal, Honduras, and Nicaragua would result in a $1.4 billion loss to the economy. “The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood,” Thompson said. Lawyers for the National TPS Alliance argued that Noem’s decisions were predetermined by President Donald Trump’s campaign promises and motivated by racial animus. Thompson agreed, saying that statements Noem and Trump have made perpetuated the “discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population.” “Color is neither a poison nor a crime,” she wrote. The advocacy group that filed the lawsuit said designees usually have a year to leave the country, but in this case, they got far less. “They gave them two months to leave the country. It’s awful,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, an attorney for plaintiffs at a hearing Tuesday. Honduras Deputy Foreign Minister Antonio García told The Associated Press, “The judge recognized the need of the (TPS holders) to be able to work in peace, tranquility and legally.” He recalled that during the first Trump administration, there was a similar legal challenge and the fight took five years in the courts. He hoped for a similar outcome this time that would allow the Hondurans to remain in the U.S. “Today’s news is hopeful and positive and gives us time and oxygen, hopefully it will be a long road, and the judge will have the final word and not President Trump,” he said. Meanwhile in Nicaragua, hundreds of thousands have fled into exile as the government shuttered thousands of nongovernmental organizations and imprisoned political opponents. Nicaragua President Daniel Ortega and his wife and co-President Rosario Murillo have consolidated complete control in Nicaragua since Ortega returned to power two decades ago. In February, a panel of U.N. experts warned the Nicaraguan government had dismantled the last remaining checks and balances and was “systematically executing a strategy to cement total control of the country through severe human rights violations.” The broad effort by the Republican administration ’s crackdown on immigration has been going after people who are in the country illegally but also by removing protections that have allowed people to live and work in the U.S. on a temporary basis. The Trump administration has already terminated protections for about 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Some have pending lawsuits at federal courts. The government argued that Noem has clear authority over the program and that her decisions reflect the administration’s objectives in the areas of immigration and foreign policy. “It is not meant to be permanent,” Justice Department attorney William Weiland said. ___ Ding reported from Los Angeles.

{"title": "El Salvador approves indefinite presidential reelection and extends terms to 6 years", "content": "▶ Lee esta historia en español SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — The party of El Salvador President Nayib Bukele approved constitutional changes in the country’s Legislative Assembly on Thursday that will allow indefinite presidential reelection and extend presidential terms to six years. Lawmaker Ana Figueroa from the New Ideas party had proposed the changes to five articles of the constitution. The proposal also included eliminating the second round of the election where the two top vote-getters from the first round face off. New Ideas and its allies in the Legislative Assembly quickly approved the proposals with the supermajority they hold. The vote passed with 57 in favor and three opposed. Bukele overwhelmingly won reelection last year despite a constitutional ban, after Supreme Court justices selected by his party ruled in 2021 to allow reelection to a second five-year term. Observers have worried that Bukele had a plan to consolidate power since at least 2021, when a newly elected Congress with a strong governing party majority voted to remove the magistrates of the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court. Those justices had been seen as the last check on the popular president. Since then, Bukele has only grown more popular. The Biden administration’s initial expressions of concern gave way to quiet acceptance as Bukele announced his run for reelection. With the return of U.S. President Donald Trump to the White House in January, Bukele had a new powerful ally and quickly offered Trump help by taking more than 200 deportees from other countries into a newly built prison for gang members.  Figueroa argued Thursday that federal lawmakers and mayors can already seek reelection as many times as they want. “All of them have had the possibility of reelection through popular vote, the only exception until now has been the presidency,” Figueroa said. She also proposed that Bukele’s current term, scheduled to end June 1, 2029, instead finish June 1, 2027, to put presidential and congressional elections on the same schedule. It would also allow Bukele to seek reelection to a longer term two years earlier. Marcela Villatoro of the Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena), one of three votes against the proposals, told her fellow lawmakers that “Democracy in El Salvador has died!” “You don’t realize what indefinite reelection brings: It brings an accumulation of power and weakens democracy ... there’s corruption and clientelism because nepotism grows and halts democracy and political participation,” she said. Suecy Callejas, the assembly’s vice president, said that “power has returned to the only place that it truly belongs ... to the Salvadoran people.” Bukele did not immediately comment. Bukele, who once dubbed himself “the world’s coolest dictator,” is highly popular, largely because of his heavy-handed fight against the country’s powerful street gangs. Voters have been willing to overlook evidence that his administration like others before it had negotiated with the gangs, before seeking a state of emergency that suspended some constitutional rights and allowed authorities to arrest and jail tens of thousands of people. His success with security and politically has inspired imitators in the region who seek to replicate his style. Most recently, Bukele’s government has faced international criticism for the arrests of high-profile lawyers who have been outspoken critics of his administration. One of the country’s most prominent human rights group announced in July it was moving its operations out of El Salvador for the safety of its people, accusing the government of a “wave of repression.”", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/el-salvador-nayib-bukele-reelection-f9efd1a08d3c9de2f886f7b911b9417d", "published_date": "2025-08-01T16:48:10.423904", "source": "ap", "topic": "tech-regulation", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:10.423912", "word_count": 573}
{"title": "Why not enough food is reaching people in Gaza even after Israel eased its blockade", "content": "International outcry over images of emaciated children and increasing reports of hunger-related deaths have pressured Israel to let more aid into the Gaza Strip. This week, Israel paused fighting in parts of Gaza and airdropped food.  But aid groups and Palestinians say the changes have only been incremental and are not enough to reverse what food experts say is a “ worst-case scenario of famine” unfolding in the war-ravaged territory. The new measures have brought an uptick in the number of aid trucks entering Gaza. But almost none of it reaches U.N. warehouses for distribution. Instead, nearly all the trucks are stripped of their cargo by crowds that overwhelm them on the roads as they drive from the borders. The crowds are a mix of Palestinians desperate for food and gangs armed with knives, axes or pistols who loot the goods to then hoard or sell. Many have also been killed trying to grab the aid. Witnesses say Israeli troops often open fire on crowds around the aid trucks, and hospitals have reported hundreds killed or wounded. The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots to control crowds or at people who approach its forces. The alternative food distribution system run by the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has also been marred by violence. International airdrops of aid have resumed. But aid groups say airdrops deliver only a fraction of what trucks can supply. Also, many parcels have landed in now-inaccessible areas that Palestinians have been told to evacuate, while others have plunged into the Mediterranean Sea, forcing people to swim out to retrieve drenched bags of flour.  Palestinians struggle to get donated food at a community kitchen, in Gaza City, northern Gaza Strip, Saturday, July 26, 2025. (AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)  Here’s a look at why the aid isn’t being distributed: The U.N. says that longstanding restrictions on the entry of aid have created an unpredictable environment, and that while a pause in fighting might allow more aid in, Palestinians are not confident aid will reach them. “This has resulted in many of our convoys offloaded directly by starving, desperate people as they continue to face deep levels of hunger and are struggling to feed their families,” said Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA. “The only way to reach a level of confidence is by having a sustained flow of aid over a period of time,” she said.

(Planet Labs PBC via AP)  Israel blocked food entirely from entering Gaza for 2 ½ months starting in March. Since it eased the blockade in late May, it allowed in a trickle of aid trucks for the U.N., about 70 a day on average, according to official Israeli figures. That is far below the 500-600 trucks a day that U.N. agencies say are needed — the amount that entered during a six-week ceasefire earlier this year. Much of the aid is stacked up just inside the border in Gaza because U.N. trucks could not pick it up. The U.N says that was because of Israeli military restrictions on its movements and because of the lawlessness in Gaza. Israel has argued that it is allowing sufficient quantities of goods into Gaza and tried to shift the blame to the U.N. “More consistent collection and distribution by U.N. agencies and international organizations = more aid reaching those who need it most in Gaza,” the Israeli military agency in charge of aid coordination, COGAT, said in a statement this week. With the new measures this week, COGAT, says 220-270 truckloads a day were allowed into Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday, and that the U.N. was able to pick up more trucks, reducing some of the backlog at the border. Palestinians hold onto an aid truck returning to Gaza City on Tuesday, July 22, 2025. (AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi, File)   Cherevko said there have been “minor improvements” in approvals by the Israeli military for its movements and some “reduced waiting times” for trucks along the road. But she said the aid missions are “still facing constraints.” Delays of military approval still mean trucks remain idle for long periods, and the military still restricts the routes that the trucks can take onto a single road, which makes it easy for people to know where the trucks are going, U.N officials say. Antoine Renard, who directs the World Food Program’s operations in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, said Wednesday that it took nearly 12 hours to bring in 52 trucks on a 10-kilometer (6 mile) route.

(Planet Labs PBC via AP)  “While we’re doing everything that we can to actually respond to the current wave of starvation in Gaza, the conditions that we have are not sufficient to actually make sure that we can break that wave,” he said. Aid workers say the changes Israel has made in recent days are largely cosmetic. “These are theatrics, token gestures dressed up as progress,” said Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam’s policy lead for Israel and the Palestinian territories. “Of course, a handful of trucks, a few hours of tactical pauses and raining energy bars from the sky is not going to fix irreversible harm done to an entire generation of children that have been starved and malnourished for months now,” she said. Palestinians carry humanitarian aid from a World Food Program convoy that was heading to Gaza City, June 16, 2025. (AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi, File)    As desperation mounts, Palestinians are risking their lives to get food, and violence is increasing, say aid workers. Muhammad Shehada, a political analyst from Gaza who is a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said aid retrieval has turned into the survival of the fittest. “It’s a Darwin dystopia, the strongest survive,” he said. A truck driver said Wednesday that he has driven food supplies four times from the Zikim crossing on Gaza’s northern border. Every time, he said, crowds a kilometer long (0.6 miles) surrounded his truck and took everything on it after he passed the checkpoint at the edge of the Israeli military-controlled border zones. He said some were desperate people, while others were armed. He said that on Tuesday, for the first time, some in the crowd threatened him with knives or small arms. He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing for his safety. Ali al-Derbashi, another truck driver, said that during one trip in July armed men shot the tires, stole everything, including the diesel and batteries and beat him. “If people weren’t starving, they wouldn’t resort to this,” he said. Israel has said it has offered the U.N. armed escorts. The U.N. has refused, saying it can’t be seen to be working with a party to the conflict – and pointing to the reported shootings when Israeli troops are present.

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana, File)    Israel hasn’t given a timeline for how long the measures it implemented this week will continue, heightening uncertainty and urgency among Palestinians to seize the aid before it ends. Palestinians say the way it’s being distributed, including being dropped from the sky, is inhumane. “This approach is inappropriate for Palestinians, we are humiliated,” said Rida, a displaced woman. Momen Abu Etayya said he almost drowned because his son begged him to get aid that fell into the sea during an aid drop. “I threw myself in the ocean to death just to bring him something,” he said. “I was only able to bring him three biscuit packets”. ___ Associated Press reporters Wafaa Shurafa in Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, Fatma Khaled in Cairo and Michael Biesecker in Washington contributed to this report.", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/aid-gaza-starvation-famine-looting-9fc8e7a652c06d9ae505b43e0c399fc8", "published_date": "2025-08-01T16:48:11.639717", "source": "ap", "topic": "tech-regulation", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:11.639726", "word_count": 1355}
{"title": "US envoy arrives in Israel to monitor Gaza food distribution as humanitarian crisis worsens", "content": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Israel on Thursday to discuss the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, as the death toll of Palestinians waiting for food and other aid continued to climb. Witkoff and U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee will inspect food distribution in Gaza on Friday, the White House said. At least 91 Palestinians were killed and more than 600 wounded while attempting to get aid in the past 24 hours, the Gaza Health Ministry said Thursday. The victims included 54 people killed while awaiting food in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing on Wednesday, the ministry said. The toll is expected to rise further as many of those killed or wounded were brought to isolated, undersupplied hospitals in northern Gaza and have not yet been counted. Israel’s military said Palestinians surrounded aid trucks and the Israeli military fired warning shots into the crowd, but reported no awareness of injuries resulting from Israeli fire. A security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations, said the gunfire came from within the crowd and resulted from altercations between Palestinians attempting to access aid.  Scenes of desperation and chaos played out again on Thursday as scores of Palestinians ran toward food aid dropped from the air in Zawaida, a city in central Gaza. Aid providers have turned to the skies as border crossings remain closed amid severe food insecurity across the Gaza Strip. The drops have set off stampedes and skirmishes as hungry crowds scream, fight and jostle for the parcels. Eslam al-Telbany, a displaced woman from Jabaliya, said she was carrying a bottle of cooking oil and a sack of flour when she was attacked and bitten, ultimately dropping the items and returning home without aid. “I went and my children prayed that I’d return with food. They haven’t eaten or drank anything for two days,” she said as she wept. Ahmed al-Khatib said someone stole a bag of flour from him, and he broke a tooth in the struggle. Rana Attia, another displaced woman, said people felt more dignified receiving text messages telling them where to collect aid rather than randomly chasing falling parcels under the scorching heat. “We don’t want them to help us that way,” she said. Despite the airdrops, the amount of aid getting into Gaza remains far lower than the 500 to 600 trucks per day that aid organizations say are needed. The Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating humanitarian aid in Gaza said 270 trucks of aid entered Gaza on Wednesday, and 32 pallets of aid were airdropped into the Strip. Under heavy international pressure, Israel announced a series of measures over the weekend to facilitate the entry of more international aid to Gaza. The international community has heaped criticism on Israel over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. International organizations said that Gaza has been on the brink of famine for the past two years, but that recent developments, including a complete blockade on aid for 2 1/2 months, mean that the “worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in Gaza.” German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul arrived in Israel on Thursday on a two-day trip that will also take him to the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Germany, traditionally a staunch ally of Israel, has been increasingly critical recently of Israel’s actions in Gaza. It has insisted that Israel must do more to increase aid supplies and pushed for a ceasefire. Berlin hasn’t joined major allies France, Britain, and Canada in saying it will recognize a Palestinian state in September. But in a statement ahead of his departure Thursday, Wadephul underlined Germany’s position that a two-state solution is “the only way” to ensure a future in peace and security for people on both sides. “For Germany, the recognition of a Palestinian state stands rather at the end of the process. But such a process must begin now. Germany will not move from this aim,” Wadephul said. Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, arrived in Israel on Thursday afternoon and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the humanitarian situation and a possible ceasefire, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. It was the first meeting between Witkoff and Netanyahu since both Israel and the U.S. called their negotiation teams home from Qatar one week ago. Witkoff said at the time that Hamas “shows a lack of desire” to reach a truce. “The fastest way to end the Humanitarian Crises in Gaza is for Hamas to SURRENDER AND RELEASE THE HOSTAGES!!!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Thursday morning. Trump sent Witkoff to the region “in an effort to save lives and end this crisis,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, calling the president “a humanitarian with a big heart.” The war started when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 251 others. They still hold 50 hostages, including around 20 believed to be alive. Most of the others have been released in ceasefires or other deals. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 60,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Its count doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians. The ministry operates under the Hamas government.

It feels very much like an object, and the survivors are not objects, women are not objects,” said Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother. “She was preyed upon, and it certainly makes you kind of ask the question, you know, how much he knew during that time?” A Trump administration official said the president is not currently considering clemency action for Maxwell. Giuffre said she was approached by Maxwell in 2000 and eventually was hired by her as a masseuse for Epstein. But the couple effectively made her a sexual servant, she said, pressuring her into gratifying not only Epstein but his friends and associates. Giuffre said she was flown around the world for appointments with men including Prince Andrew while she was 17 and 18 years old. The men, including Andrew, denied it and assailed Giuffre’s credibility. She acknowledged changing some key details of her account. The prince settled with Giuffre in 2022 for an undisclosed sum, agreeing to make a “substantial donation” to her survivors’ organization. The American-born Giuffre lived in Australia for years and became an advocate for sex trafficking survivors after emerging as a central figure in Epstein’s prolonged downfall.

{"title": "Judge blocks Trump administration from ending protections for 60,000 from Central America and Nepal", "content": "▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday against the Trump administration’s plans and extended Temporary Protected Status for 60,000 people from Central America and Asia, including people from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua. Temporary Protected Status is a protection that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people of various nationalities who are in the United States, preventing from being deported and allowing them to work. The Trump administration has aggressively been seeking to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal. It’s part of a wider effort by the administration to carry out mass deportations of immigrants. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem can extend Temporary Protected Status to immigrants in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe to return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions. Noem had ruled to end protections for tens of thousands of Hondurans and Nicaraguans after determining that conditions in their homelands no longer warranted them. The secretary said the two countries had made “significant progress” in recovering from 1998’s Hurricane Mitch, one of the deadliest Atlantic storms in history. The designation for an estimated 7,000 from Nepal was scheduled to end Aug. 5 while protections allowing 51,000 Hondurans and nearly 3,000 Nicaraguans who have been in the U.S. for more than 25 years were set to expire Sept. 8. ◆ Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson in San Francisco did not set an expiration date but rather ruled to keep the protections in place while the case proceeds. The next hearing is Nov. 18.  In a sharply written order, Thompson said the administration ended the migrant status protections without an “objective review of the country conditions” such as political violence in Honduras and the impact of recent hurricanes and storms in Nicaragua. If the protections were not extended, immigrants could suffer from loss of employment, health insurance, be separated from their families, and risk being deported to other countries where they have no ties, she wrote, adding that the termination of Temporary Protection Status for people from Nepal, Honduras, and Nicaragua would result in a $1.4 billion loss to the economy. “The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood,” Thompson said. Lawyers for the National TPS Alliance argued that Noem’s decisions were predetermined by President Donald Trump’s campaign promises and motivated by racial animus. Thompson agreed, saying that statements Noem and Trump have made perpetuated the “discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population.” “Color is neither a poison nor a crime,” she wrote. The advocacy group that filed the lawsuit said designees usually have a year to leave the country, but in this case, they got far less. “They gave them two months to leave the country. It’s awful,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, an attorney for plaintiffs at a hearing Tuesday. Honduras Deputy Foreign Minister Antonio García told The Associated Press, “The judge recognized the need of the (TPS holders) to be able to work in peace, tranquility and legally.” He recalled that during the first Trump administration, there was a similar legal challenge and the fight took five years in the courts. He hoped for a similar outcome this time that would allow the Hondurans to remain in the U.S. “Today’s news is hopeful and positive and gives us time and oxygen, hopefully it will be a long road, and the judge will have the final word and not President Trump,” he said. Meanwhile in Nicaragua, hundreds of thousands have fled into exile as the government shuttered thousands of nongovernmental organizations and imprisoned political opponents. Nicaragua President Daniel Ortega and his wife and co-President Rosario Murillo have consolidated complete control in Nicaragua since Ortega returned to power two decades ago. In February, a panel of U.N. experts warned the Nicaraguan government had dismantled the last remaining checks and balances and was “systematically executing a strategy to cement total control of the country through severe human rights violations.” The broad effort by the Republican administration ’s crackdown on immigration has been going after people who are in the country illegally but also by removing protections that have allowed people to live and work in the U.S. on a temporary basis. The Trump administration has already terminated protections for about 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Some have pending lawsuits at federal courts. The government argued that Noem has clear authority over the program and that her decisions reflect the administration’s objectives in the areas of immigration and foreign policy. “It is not meant to be permanent,” Justice Department attorney William Weiland said. ___ Ding reported from Los Angeles.

{"title": "Zelensky demands tougher sanctions after Russian strikes kill 31 in Kyiv ", "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for stronger international sanctions on Russia after a deadly attack on Kyiv killed at least 31 people. Zelensky said five children - the youngest aged two - were among the dead and 159 people - including 16 children - had been wounded in the assault on the Ukrainian capital on Thursday.\"No matter how much the Kremlin denies their effectiveness, sanctions do work - and they must be strengthened,\" he said. Kyiv observed a day of mourning after the attack collapsed an apartment block and damaged a hospital, school, nursery and university. Russia launched more than 300 drones and eight cruise missiles in Thursday's assault, Ukraine's air force said. The attack was one of the deadliest Kyiv has experienced since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a large-scale invasion in February 2022.US President Donald Trump condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine and suggested new sanctions against Moscow were coming.\"Russia, I think it's disgusting what they're doing. I think it's disgusting,\" he told journalists.In July, Trump said Putin had 50 days to end the war, or Russia would face severe tariffs targeting its oil and other exports. On Monday, Trump set a new \"10 or 12\" day deadline. He later set a new deadline, which would expire on 8 August. Putin must agree Ukraine ceasefire in 10 or 12 days, says Trump Senior US diplomat John Kelley told the UN Security Council on Thursday that Russia and Ukraine \"must negotiate a ceasefire and durable peace\".\"It is time to make a deal,\" he said.

{"title": "EU-US tariff deal not finished yet, say Europeans unhappy with Trump's terms", "content": "It was all handshakes and smiles when European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and US President Donald Trump announced that a EU-US trade agreement had been reached after months of wrangling - beating Trump's deadline of 1 August to make a deal.Many across Europe breathed a sigh of relief that European negotiators had avoided 30% tariffs threatened by Trump months ago. Other countries are still racing to finalise deals with the US to avoid sweeping levies.But since news of the US-EU deal was announced last weekend, not only has criticism mounted, but it has become clear many details are yet to be ironed out, there are several discrepancies between the two sides and some EU countries will be disproportionately affected. Few European leaders rejoiced at the announcement that a 15% tariff would be applied on most EU exports to the US - an improvement on the 30% tariff initially threatened by Trump, but still a substantial hike from the former 4.8% average rate. LIVE coverage: Trump raises Canada tariff to 35% as US announces new levies for dozens of countries Yet, while expressing regret that the EU had not adopted a tougher negotiating stance, many begrudgingly agreed the deal had at least brought a semblance of certainty and predictability to Europe's businesses after a number of fraught months.\"I would have wished for a different outcome,\" Germany's finance minister Lars Klingbeil said. \"Still, all in all, it is good that there is an agreement with the US, that there are no further escalations.\"As of Thursday, a joint statement had yet to be released, although the Commission has emphasised it will not be a legally binding document but a \"set of political commitments\". \"From there will flow the additional negotiated exemptions that we're looking to bake into our agreement with the US,\" Commission trade spokesperson Olof Gill said.The Commission's general outline of the deal stressed it was not legally binding.The White House fact sheet on the agreement presents none of these caveats and says it achieves \"historic structural reforms\", but US Commerce chief Howard Lutnick admitted on Wednesday that talks would continue and that EU and US officials were still discussing some aspects of the framework.\"This isn't the end of the story and we won't leave it at that,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said. \"It's the first step in a negotiation process that will continue.\"Trade agreements usually take between 18 and 24 months of bilateral negotiations, says Cinzia Alcidi of the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels. \"To give some certainty to the industry and private sectors now, the 15% blanket tariff will apply – but then there will be efforts to get some goods a different deal,\" she says. According to the White House, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors will fall under the 15% tariff, with no mention of that number being the upper limit. But the EU says the two sectors will remain on the current 0% rate for now and until new global tariff rates are agreed. Any future tariffs, according to the EU, will be capped at 15%.Tariffs on steel and aluminium, according to the US, will remain at 50%. The EU says Brussels and Washington will work to cut that number and that they will be replaced by a quota system to come beyond 1 August.Some of the most glaring discrepancies can be found in the language used by the two sides to describe the EU's investment commitments. Where the US statement says the EU \"will\" purchase $750bn (£568bn) in US oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and nuclear energy products, the EU says only that it \"intends\" to do so as it weans itself off Russian gas and oil.Not only is it unclear whether the US can even provide such amounts to the EU, says Cinzia Alcidi, but the EU cannot decide purchases on behalf of the private sector. Similarly, the US says the EU will invest $600bn by the end of Trump's second term – but the EU states simply that \"companies have expressed interest\" in investing that sum by 2029. As Brussels cannot force private firms to invest in the US, there is technically no guarantee that amount can or will be reached.According to the US, the EU has \"agreed to purchase significant amounts\" of US military equipment. There is no mention of this in the EU statement. Nearly 80% of the EU's defence investment already goes to the US, and scaling up further may not be possible; besides, such a commitment would be at odds with von der Leyen's recent ReArm Europe plan, which calls for investments in Europe's domestic defence industry.And while negotiations continue, the US will also apply a 15% tariff on wine and spirits, the Commission said on Thursday, adding it would continue to try and achieve a carve-out.On Wednesday, Macron said the agreement had the merit of offering \"predictability in the short term\" - but also called for Europe to be firmer with the US.\"In order to be free you have to be feared. We weren't feared enough,\" he said.Given the amount of detail that still needs hammering out, the next phase of negotiations is set to continue for some time - and after the backlash the Commission received this week, European negotiators may feel under greater pressure to stand their ground. Although the 15% tariffs will hit all European countries, they will affect them in different ways.Germany, Ireland and Italy are particularly exposed due to the nature of their partnerships with the US. For Germany's carmakers, the US represents 13% of their exports worth €34bn (£29bn). Hildegard Müller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, said the new tariffs would be a costly burden.Among EU countries, Ireland is the most reliant on the US as an export market. In particular it manufactures and exports pharmaceuticals worth $50bn a year – so Dublin welcomed the EU-US agreement through gritted teeth. \"It is what it is and we move on,\" said Neale Richmond, a minister of state in Ireland's foreign affairs department.Italy's agricultural, pharmaceutical and automotive sectors will also suffer and the country's gross domestic product (GDP) could take a 0.2% hit as a result of the 15% levy, according to the Italian Institute of International Political Studies. Cristiano Fini of the Italian Confederation of Farmers said the deal with the US felt more like \"a surrender\" than an agreement. Several Italian trade associations are now already clamouring for compensation from the EU to make up for the predicted losses.But that is exactly what the EU needs to resist, says Cinzia Alcidi. Blanket compensation for EU exporters would end up costing taxpayers, she believes, \"and that would constitute a great victory for Trump because it would mean that, ultimately, Europeans are paying the price of his tariffs\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgp5q4x4nzo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_date": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 16:15:46 GMT", "source": "bbc", "topic": "russia-ukraine-conflict", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:21.616193", "word_count": 1128}
{"title": "Young Ukrainians get their way as Zelensky overturns law to defuse crisis", "content": "As Ukraine's MPs gathered at parliament in Kyiv on Thursday, some held cardboard signs that read, \"We are with our people.\"It was a message to thousands of young protesters who had taken part in the biggest anti-government demonstrations since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. They were out in force again on Thursday.The MPs then entered parliament, the Rada, and took part in a vote that overwhelmingly overturned a law introduced by President Volodymyr Zelensky last week that curtailed the independence of two key anti-corruption agencies known as Nabu and Sap -  the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office. The signs carried by the MPs outside the Rada were a nod to the placards carried by thousands of young people who had taken to the streets in towns and cities across Ukraine for almost a week.The protesters had demanded that Zelensky and his government \"take their hands off\" the two anti-corruption bodies, and threatened to continue to carry on until the government made a U-turn.Within days, it did. Zelensky's original bill had stripped the two bodies of their independent authority to decide who to prosecute in high-level corruption cases, giving that prerogative to the general prosecutor - a presidential appointee.For the placard-waving protesters, safeguarding the independence of Nabu and Sap was as crucial to their European future as the war against Russia was a matter of life and death for their country.In 2022, Kyiv was granted the coveted status of EU candidate country – but on condition it mounted a credible fight against corruption.For Ukraine's Western partners - donors and investors who pour money into the country through international assistance and funding programmes - the existence and independence of the two anti-corruption bodies are non-negotiable.And for Ukraine and its war-shattered economy, that external financial help is critical.It was only 10 days earlier that MPs had backed Zelensky's controversial law, and yet they voted on Thursday by 331 to 0 to overturn it. On both occasions they appeared to be following Zelensky's direction.\"Ukraine is a democracy - there are definitely no doubts,\" he said on social media. Many Ukrainians see the hand of Zelensky's right-hand man, Andriy Yermak, behind the president's recent choices.Yermak's position as head of the presidential office is not regulated by the constitution nor limited by any checks or balances. And questions are being asked about such a role in Ukraine's democracy.Safeguarding that democracy and Ukraine's course towards European integration were the key drivers for the young protesters, while their parents and friends were defending their country on the front lines.MPs did their best to show the problem was now solved, but this crisis has left behind an unpleasant aftertaste.It has brought into question Zelensky's dedication to the anti-corruption reforms.That he seemed ready to compromise on these reforms may have seriously dented the trust the EU put in him. Kyiv death tolls rises to 16 as wave of Russian strikes defies Trump demandZelensky backtracks on law after protestsUkrainecast: Can Zelensky recover from nationwide protests? Some made the link between the government's bid to curtail the independence of Nabu and Sap. Powerful figures in Zelensky's circle have come under scrutiny, with some either facing charges or investigation.Zelensky's move also came after the government rejected a candidate selected by an independent commission to head the Bureau for Economic Security - the main agency for investigating economic crimes in Ukraine.The official reason Oleksandr Tsyvinski didn't get the job was that he didn't get the security clearance from the security service, which is under the president's control.However, Tsyvinski is a well-regarded anti-corruption expert and the selection commission still wants him appointed.All these elements resulted in one of the biggest power crises for Zelensky's team since he came to power in 2019.Three-and-a-half years into the full-scale war, the risk of further such mis-steps could come at a significant cost.Next year, Ukraine's budget deficit could hit $13bn (£10bn), according to a National Bank estimate. Kyiv would not be able to continue fighting the war if it were to lose Western partners' support.Already, the EU has reduced some of its financial aid to Ukraine because the government has not kept up with promised reforms.Ukraine's young protesters appear to have understood that all too well, and were prepared to challenge their government in a country they chose to stay despite the deadly threat of Russian drone and missile attacks.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv0n0ky4xro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_date": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 21:19:39 GMT", "source": "bbc", "topic": "russia-ukraine-conflict", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:22.170658", "word_count": 725}

Jordan confirmed he had died after a gruesome IS video appeared to show the 26-year-old being burned alive in a cage. Profile: Jordanian pilot Moaz al-KasasbehMan charged over killing of Jordanian pilot burned alive by IS Krayem had denied the charges, Swedish public broadcaster SVT reported, and said he was unaware of the plans for the killing.While the evidence showed that the fire that killed Lt Kasasbeh was lit by another man, Krayem was also involved in the killing, the court said.\"The defendant, through his actions, contributed so actively to the death of the pilot that he should be considered a perpetrator,\" presiding Judge Anna Liljenberg Gullesjo said in a statement.He was at the execution site \"uniformed and armed, and allowed himself to be filmed,\" the statement added.Krayem, 32, who is already serving a 30-year sentence for his role in the Paris attacks and a life term for the Brussels attacks, was given a second life sentence by the court in Stockholm.The judge added that Krayem's actions consisted of \"guarding the victim both before and during the execution and taking him to the cage where he was set alight\".The court also awarded compensation to Lt Kasasbeh's parents and siblings of around 80,000 Swedish kronor ($8,200/£6,198) each.Lt Kasasbeh was captured when his plane came down near the city of Raqqa during a mission against IS in December 2014.At the time of his death in early 2015, Jordan - which was part of a US-led coalition fighting IS in Syria - had been attempting to secure his release as part of a prisoner swap.\"It is painful for my parents to be confronted with this event again, but we are grateful that the Swedish authorities want to give us justice,\" the pilot's brother, Jawdat al-Kasasbeh, told Swedish broadcaster Sveriges Radio when charges were initially announced.Krayem is originally from the Swedish city of Malmo and is thought to have travelled to Syria in September 2014 to fight for IS.In June 2022, he was sentenced for his role in the November 2015 Paris attacks - in which 130 people were killed - and for planning a separate attack on Amsterdam airport.A year later, he was also found guilty of terrorist murder for his role in the Brussels attacks that killed 32 people.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd04nn7q75o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_date": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 13:05:05 GMT", "source": "bbc", "topic": "russia-ukraine-conflict", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:22.940360", "word_count": 469}
{"title": "France-Spain flight row over Jewish teens escalates", "content": "The removal of a French group of Jewish teenagers from a flight in Spain last week has prompted a diplomatic row, after their group leader was handcuffed by police and a Spanish minister called them \"Israeli brats\".French government ministers Aurore Bergé and Benjamin Haddad have given a strongly worded statement condemning Spain's transport minister Óscar Puente's remarks and the actions of police.The teenagers and their counsellor were among the group of 44 children and eight adults who were taken off Vueling flight V8166 from Valencia to Paris on 23 July while on their way home from a summer camp. Vueling says the French group was removed from the flight because of \"disruptive behaviour\". The airline has said it aims \"to provide a rigorous and transparent account of the facts\".However, accounts of what happened before the incident differ dramatically, and have led to allegations of antisemitism, which have been vehemently rejected by both the airline and Spanish police.Videos on social media showed police holding the female counsellor down on the ground in a corridor while they handcuffed her.The two French ministers, who have both since spoken to the woman, said she had been signed off work for 15 days because of \"temporary incapacity\".\"No act justifies the disembarkation and the excessive and brutal use of force by the Guardia Civil against the young woman,\" said Bergé and Haddad.Although Óscar Puente later deleted his post describing the teenagers as \"Israeli brats\", the French ministers said they strongly condemned his statement for \"equating French children who were Jewish with Israeli citizens, as if this in any way justified the treatment they were subjected to\".\"We will never accept the trivialisation of anti-Semitism,\" the ministers added.Police said the captain had ordered the removal of the group from the Vueling plane after they had ignored instructions from the crew.The airline has given two statements since the events unfolded a week ago.It alleged that the group had \"mishandled emergency equipment and actively disrupted the mandatory safety demonstration, repeatedly ignoring instructions from cabin crew\".Vueling said that as part of its internal inquiry it had taken witness statements from other passengers who had backed up its account and that of the police. It accused some of the children of adopting \"confrontational behaviour\"... such as \"attempting to loosen life jackets, tampering with overhead oxygen masks and removing a high-pressure oxygen cylinder\", violating air safety laws. However, other accounts have disputed the airline's version of events.One passenger called Damien, who was at the front of the plane and not part of the young group, told Europe 1 radio that the children had been \"very calm, especially for teenagers... there was one who called to his friend for two seconds but everything was perfectly fine\".Karine Lamy, the mother of a teenage boy in the group, told i24 TV that \"one child sang a song in Hebrew, then he began shouting and the staff on board came up to him and the group leader and warned him immediately that if he carried on singing or making a noise they'd call the police\". She said the children then calmed down and five minutes later the police boarded the plane and told the leader and the whole group to disembark.According to Damien, a flight attendant said during the safety demonstration that there was a security issue and that they were going to call police.\"There was no shouting, no violence,\" he insisted, adding that he had no idea whether there had been any interruption to the safety demonstration as everyone was paying attention to it at the time.One anonymous passenger gave a statement to Spain's La Sexta TV appearing to back up Vueling's statement, saying that some of the children had pulled life jackets out and pressed the crew-call buttons.A lawyer for the Club Kineret summer camp group, Murielle Ouknine-Melki, told French TV that some of the children wore a kippah (Jewish skullcap) and she had no other explanation for what happened other than that they were Jewish.Vueling said it categorically denied that its crew's behaviour related to the religion of the passengers. The Guardia Civil said its officers too were not aware they were Jewish.At the weekend, France's foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, contacted Vueling's chief executive, Carolina Martinoli, to express his \"deep concern\" at what had happened.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y2mz3m2dxo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_date": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 23:22:01 GMT", "source": "bbc", "topic": "russia-ukraine-conflict", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:23.903016", "word_count": 711}
{"title": "2,500-year-old Siberian 'ice mummy' had intricate tattoos, imaging reveals", "content": "High-resolution imaging of tattoos found on a 2,500 year old Siberian \"ice mummy\" have revealed decorations that a modern tattooist would find challenging to produce, according to researchers.The intricate tattoos of leopards, a stag, a rooster, and a mythical half-lion and half-eagle creature on the woman's body shed light on an ancient warrior culture.Archaeologists worked with a tattooist, who reproduces ancient skin decorations on his own body, to understand how exactly they were made.The tattooed woman, aged about 50, was from the nomadic horse-riding Pazyryk people who lived on the vast steppe between China and Europe. The scans revealed \"intricate crisp and uniform\" tattooing that could not be seen with the naked eye.\"The insights really drive home to me the point of how sophisticated these people were,\" lead author Dr Gino Caspari from the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology and the University of Bern, told BBC News.It is difficult to uncover detailed information about ancient social and cultural practices because most evidence is destroyed over time. It is even harder to get up close to the details of one person's life.The Pazyryk \"ice mummies\" were found inside ice tombs in the Altai mountains in Siberia in the 19th century, but it has been difficult to see the tattoos. Now using near-infrared digital photography in the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, Russia experts have created high resolution scans of the decorations for the first time.\"This made me feel like we were much closer to seeing the people behind the art, how they worked and learned. The images came alive,\" Dr Caspari said.On her right forearm, the Pazyryk woman had an image of leopards around the head of a deer. On the left arm, the mythical griffin creature with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle appears to be fighting with a stag.\"Twisted hind bodies and really intense battle scenes of wild animals are typical of the culture,\" Dr Caspari said.But the woman also had a rooster on her thumb, showing \"an intriguing style with a certain uniqueness,\" says Dr Caspari.The team worked with researcher Daniel Riday who reproduces ancient tattoo designs on his body using historical methods. His insights on the scans led them to conclude that the quality of the work differed between the two arms, suggesting that a different person made the tattoos or that mistakes were made.\"If I was guessing, it was probably four and half hours for the lower half of the right arm, and another five hours for the upper part,\" he says.\"That's a solid commitment from the person. Imagine sitting on the ground in the steppe where there's wind blowing all that time,\" he suggests.\"It would need to be performed by a person who knows health and safety, who knows the risks of what happens when the skin is punctured,\" he adds. By analysing the marks in the woman's skin, the team believe that the tattoos were probably stencilled onto the skin before being tattooed.They think a needle-like tool with small multiple points probably made from animal horn or bone was used, as well as a single point needle. The pigment was likely made from burnt plant material or soot.Dr Caspari, who does not have tattoos himself, says the work sheds light on an ancient practice that is very important for a lot of people around the world today. \"And back in the day it was already a really professional practice where people put a lot of time and effort and practice into creating these images and they're extremely sophisticated,\" he adds.Some of the tattoos appear to have been cut or damaged when the body was prepared for burial.\"It suggests that tattoos were really something for the living with meaning during life, but that they actually didn't really play much of a role in the afterlife,\" explains Dr Caspari.The findings are published in the journal Antiquity.

{"title": "'Communities' of strange, extreme life seen for first time in deep ocean", "content": "Beds of clams, mats of bacteria that look like ice and fields of tube worms -  these are just some examples of the strange, extreme life that an expedition to the deepest parts of the ocean has observed, filmed and photographed.Diving in a human-occupied submersible to ocean trenches in the northwest Pacific Ocean, a Chinese-led research team captured pictures of life at depths of more than 9km (5.6miles).The deepest marine vertebrate life filmed before this expedition was at 8,336m  - a snailfish that was filmed swimming in a deep ocean trench off the coast of Japan in 2023.These new observations are published in the journal Nature. Although it was accepted among marine scientists that there would be life at these depths, scientists on this mission say the abundance of animals they saw from the windows of their submersible was \"amazing\".The scientific expedition covered more than 2,500km - exploring trenches at depths ranging from 5,800 to 9,533m.Oxygen discovery defies knowledge of the deep oceanDeepest-ever sub dive finds plastic bagResearchers travelled in a submersible vehicle called Fendouzhe, which can operate at depths of more than 10km for several hours at a time.The team, led by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Deep Sea Science and Engineering,  discovered what they describe as \"thriving communities\" of creatures. \"It's exciting - especially for a deep sea scientist - to go to a place that human beings have not explored,\" one of the lead researchers, Dr Xiaotong Peng, told BBC News. \"It's a great opportunity to discover new things. And what we saw was quite amazing.\"Scientists photographed and filmed what looked like fields of marine life - dominated by various different types of tube worm and mollusc. These animals live in the pitch dark and under vast pressure.With no sunlight, life at these depths is fuelled by chemicals that seep out of the ocean floor. Hydrogen sulfide and methane seep out of faults - or cracks -  in the Earth's crust.The scientists say they have recorded species never seen before. In future studies, they hope to work out how the bodies of these so called \"chemosynthetic\" or chemical-fuelled creatures convert these chemicals into energy.\"They must [also] have a trick to adapt to life in super high pressure,\" added Dr Megran Du, also from China's Institute of Deep Sea Science and Engineering. \"That's another question we need to answer.\" The findings challenge \"long-standing assumptions\" about life's potential at such extreme depths and pressures. They also suggest that these communities of animals, rather than extreme rarities, are actually widespread.Prof Andrew Sweetman, a senior scientist from the Scottish Association for marine science told BBC News that the discovery showed that whole \"ecosystems driven by methane may exist in the deepest parts of the ocean\".And how did it feel, for a scientist, to descend to such extreme, pitch-black depths?Dr Du told BBC News: \"Some people might find it frightening, but I always encourage my students - look through the window at the bottom of the sea,\" she said. \"You will be inspired.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wnqe5j99do?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_date": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 00:02:31 GMT", "source": "bbc", "topic": "climate-change-policy", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:25.774855", "word_count": 505}
{"title": "Why did Russian mega earthquake not cause more tsunami damage?", "content": "It has been one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded – but so far has not brought the catastrophic tsunami that many feared.When the 8.8-magnitude quake struck eastern Russia at 11:25 local time on Wednesday (00:25 BST), it raised concerns for coastal populations across the Pacific.Millions of people were evacuated, as minds cast back to the devastating tsunami of Boxing Day 2004 in the Indian Ocean and Japan 2011, both triggered by similarly large earthquakes.But today's tsunami has been much less severe, even though it's brought some damage.So what caused the earthquake and tsunami – and why wasn't it as bad as initially feared? The Kamchatka Peninsula is remote but lies in the \"Pacific Ring of Fire\" - so called because of the high number of earthquakes and volcanoes that occur here.The upper layers of the Earth are split into sections – tectonic plates – which are all moving relative to one another.The \"Pacific Ring of Fire\" is an arc of these plates that extends around the Pacific. Eighty percent of the world's earthquakes occur along the ring, according to the British Geological Survey.Just off the coast of the Peninsula, the Pacific plate is moving north-west at about 8cm (3in) per year - only about twice the rate that your fingernails grow, but fast by tectonic standards.There it comes into contact with another, smaller plate - called the Okhotsk microplate.The Pacific plate is oceanic, which means it has dense rocks and wants to sink beneath the less dense microplate.As the Pacific plate sinks towards the centre of the Earth, it heats up and begins to melt, effectively disappearing.But this process is not always smooth. Often the plates can get stuck as they move past each other and the overriding plate is dragged downwards. This friction can build up over thousands of years, but can then be suddenly released in just a couple of minutes. This is known as a megathrust earthquake.\"When we typically think about earthquakes, we imagine an epicentre as a small point on a map. However, for such large earthquakes, the fault will have ruptured over many hundreds of kilometres,\" explained Dr Stephen Hicks, lecturer in environmental seismology at University College London.\"It is this vast amount of slip and area of the fault that generates such a high earthquake magnitude.\"The largest earthquakes recorded in history, including the three strongest in Chile, Alaska and Sumatra, were all megathrust earthquakes. And the Kamchatka Peninsula is prone to strong quakes. In fact, another high magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck less than 30km (19mi) from today's earthquake in 1952, the US Geological Survey says. This sudden movement can displace water above the plates, which can then travel to the coastline as tsunami.In the deep ocean, tsunami can travel at more than 500mph (800km/h), about as fast as a passenger aeroplane.Here, the distance between waves is very long and the waves aren't very high – rarely more than a metre.But as a tsunami enters shallow water near land, it slows down, often to about 20-30mph.The distance between waves shortens, and waves grow in height, which can effectively create a wall of water near the coast.But it's by no means guaranteed that a very strong earthquake will lead to a particularly tall tsunami reaching far inland. Today's quake brought tsunami waves of 4m (13ft) in parts of eastern Russia, according to authorities there. But they don't come close to the waves tens-of-metres high of Boxing Day 2004 in the Indian Ocean and Japan 2011. \"The height of the tsunami wave is also affected by local shapes of the seafloor near the coast and the [shape] of the land where it arrives,\" said Prof Lisa McNeill, professor of tectonics at the University of Southampton. \"These factors, along with how populated the coast is, affect how serious the impact is,\" she added.Initial reports from the US Geological Survey said that the earthquake was centred at quite a narrow depth, about 20.7km (12.9 miles) below the Earth's surface.That can lead to greater displacement of the seafloor, and therefore a bigger tsunami wave, but it's hard to tell for sure so soon after the event.\"One possibility is that the tsunami models have maybe taken a conservative estimate on the earthquake depth,\" Dr Hicks told BBC News.\"Potentially you could shift that earthquake another 20 kilometres deeper, and that would actually reduce the amplitude of the tsunami waves quite considerably.\" Another important element is the development of early warning systems.Due to the high occurrence of earthquakes in the Pacific region, many countries have tsunami centres. They send out warnings via public announcements for populations to evacuate.No such system was in place when the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami occurred - leaving many people without time to evacuate. More than 230,000 people died across 14 countries in the Indian Ocean. Early warning systems are important because of the limited ability of scientists to predict when an earthquake will occur. The US Geological Survey recorded an earthquake measuring 7.4 in the same region ten days before. This may have been a foreshock - an early release of energy - but it is not a predictor of exact timing of a future earthquake, explained Prof McNeill. \"Although we can use how fast the plates are moving, GPS to measure current movements and when previous earthquakes occurred, we can only use this information to make forecasts of probability of an earthquake,\" she said. The Geophysical Survey of the Russian Academy of Sciences (GS RAS) will continue to monitor the region as it anticipates aftershocks could continue for the next month.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l6pj7kjg7o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_date": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 16:09:03 GMT", "source": "bbc", "topic": "climate-change-policy", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:26.584013", "word_count": 924}
{"title": "UK gets first female Astronomer Royal in 350 years", "content": "Astronomer Prof Michele Dougherty did not study science in secondary school – but was instead inspired to learn more about space after using her father's telescope.Now she is the first woman to be appointed the UK's Astronomer Royal in the post's 350-year history, and is part of the team sending probes to Jupiter's icy moons.She told BBC News she hoped her appointment on Wednesday as the official adviser to King Charles III on astronomical matters would inspire more women and girls to study science.The new Astronomer Royal added that she also wanted to use her new role to \"open people's eyes\" to the wonders of space. \"I want to engage with the public, excite them about what we do in astronomy, but also make it clear how important what we do is to the UK economy,\" Prof Dougherty said.Prof Dougherty is involved in one of the most exciting space missions to date: a European Space Agency probe to the icy moons of Jupiter to assess whether they have the potential to support life.\"It would be surprising if there wasn't life in our solar system,\" she said laughing, with the unbridled enthusiasm she is known for.Her journey to Jupiter began at the age of 10 and saw the planet through a telescope she, her sister and her father built.\"That was when I got my first view of Jupiter and four large moons, never thinking I'd end up sending instruments on a spacecraft there,\" she said.\"I'm having to pinch myself at the thought of it and I'm having to pinch myself at the fact that I'm now Astronomer Royal!\"Prof Dougherty's achievement is all the more remarkable as she did not study science at secondary school in South Africa where she grew up.\"I had a choice between schools. One of them taught science, but none of my friends were going to it,\" she said. \"So as a young 13-year-old, I thought, I want to go with my friends.\"But the young Prof Dougherty was so good at maths that she was admitted to a science course at university.\"The first couple of years were hard. It was like learning a new language,\" she said.But she soon caught up and came to the UK to become one of the country's leading space scientists, showing tremendous courage as well as talent.\"I said yes to things I didn't know how to do, and I learned as I went,\" she told me. The role of Astronomer Royal dates back to the creation of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich in 1675. John Flamsteed from Derby was the first person to fill the role. The job back then was mostly to advise the king on using the stars to improve navigation at sea.The observatory's senior curator, Dr Louise Devoy, explained that the job evolved over the years, to become one of the most important scientific voices in the country.\"By the 1800s the Astronomer Royal started to be called upon to act as a government advisor, so that may be to advise on the railways or bridges or telegraphy, a whole range of topics beyond astronomy,\" she said.\"If we fast forward to the 20th Century, it is more about developing international collaborations, which is why you have British astronomers working in telescopes in Chile, the Canary Islands and even the James Webb Space Telescope.\"Over three and a half centuries,15 men have held the post of the most senior astronomer for all of the UK. But at the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh, Prof Catherine Heyman has held an equivalent post as Astronomer Royal for Scotland since 2021.She was delighted to hear of Prof Dougherty's appointment.\"For the last 350 years the title of Astronomer Royal has been held by a white male astronomer, and that kind of reflected what the astronomical community has looked like for the last few centuries. But things are changing,\" she said.\"Science is becoming more diverse, which it needs to be if we want to answer these big questions, and I'm absolutely delighted now that the two Astronomers Royal across the UK are female, reflecting the fact that science is for everyone.\" Prof Dougherty herself does not want to make a big deal of the fact that she is the first woman to hold the UK-wide post, but she hopes it will inspire others to follow in her footsteps.\"I think it is important. I think when young children in particular see someone that looks like them doing a job they think they would never get an opportunity to do, it changes their mindset a little,\" she told BBC News. Prof Dougherty experienced this when she was head of the physics department at Imperial College between 2018 and 2024. During that time, the percentage of first year female undergraduates who came to Imperial increased from about 19% to 25%. \"Not a huge change,\" she said, \"but there was a positive change. And I think it's because students saw that I was in a role that they might aspire to in the future\".

{"title": "Thousands of river pollution tests cancelled because of staff shortages", "content": "Thousands of water tests to identify potential harmful pollution in rivers, lakes and estuaries in England have been cancelled in the last three months due to staff shortages, the BBC has learned.The Environment Agency confirmed the cancellations after campaigners showed us internal emails and documents with plans for extensive cuts to monitoring programmes.The cancelled tests are for so-called inorganic pollutants - substances such as nitrates and phosphates that can indicate sewage or agricultural pollution.The EA says its testing programme \"remains robust\" but this week a landmark report said it had \"struggled to effectively oversee and manage the water system\". In the three months from May to July the water regulator says that 10,000 scheduled tests at its main laboratory at Starcross in Devon did not take place due to staff shortages.Others were combined with other tests or postponed in what the EA says was an \"optimisation\" process.The Environment Agency said seven national inorganic testing programmes had been completely \"paused\". They include programmes that track chemical pollution in rivers, lakes and estuaries as well as one that monitors the regulator's plans for dealing with drought. Jo Bradley, who worked at the Environment Agency's water quality team for more than 20 years, told the BBC: \"Some inorganic substances, such as copper and zinc, are directly toxic to aquatic organisms, including fish and insects,\" \"Others, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, are nutrients and they can affect river health when they are present in high quantities. \"These substances must be tested routinely, at many hundreds of locations, so that we can see trends in river chemistry and quickly identify problems.\"The EA said it \"paused\" 17.5% of its inorganic testing at the Starcross Laboratory from May to July. Over the entire year it said it was expecting to operate at 15% below capacity. A spokesperson blamed the reduction in tests on \"fluctuations in staffing capacity\" and said the laboratory would be working at full capacity again by October. Staffing problems are nothing new at the EA. In 2023 its chairman Alan Lovell told parliament that it had \"struggled with recruitment and retention of staff\".Internal emails obtained by campaign groups Greenpeace and Desmog through freedom of information requests were shared with the BBC. They show EA officials discussing the impact of staff departures on testing and saying that others planned to leave.One senior official, writing an email to her colleagues, said it was \"not good news I'm afraid\" adding \"this isn't where we want to be (again)\".Helen Nightingale, who worked at the Environment Agency as a catchment planner, analysing data from its water quality programme until 2022, says that while she was there she saw a shift of focus away from serious investigation to trying to find \"successes\". She also said that morale was low: \"The pay is not great – we didn't have pay rises for years due to austerity, \"But a lot people are in it [the EA] because they want to make a difference – and when you're not even getting that - well, what's the point?\"Documents seen by the BBC show that the work affected by the cuts to testing this year included investigations into the water industry in various parts of the country, and monitoring of protected areas including the River Wye, which is currently facing a pollution crisis linked to intensive chicken farming. Stuart Singleton White from the Angling Trust which has been running its own citizen scientist testing programme., said: \"This spring, while the EA cut 10,000 water samples, our Water Quality Monitoring Network collected its 10,000th.\"Our latest annual report showed that 34% of sites breached \"good ecological status\" for phosphate, and 45% showed signs of nitrate pollution. Pollution is out of control, and extensive testing is key to addressing the problem.\" Singer-turned-campaigner Feargal Sharkey said the cancelled tests are further confirmation of the EA's limitations. \"When is a regulator not a regulator? When it's the Environment Agency,\" Mr Sharkey told the BBC. \"With impeccable timing the Environment Agency reminds us all of exactly why they to should be added to Sir Jon Cunliffe's bonfire of the quangos [the Water Commission]. Institutionally incompetent, complacent and discredited.\"This week, Sir Jon recommended that a single water regulator be created, with the EA handing over responsibility for monitoring water pollution. A spokesperson for the EA said: \"We are committed to protecting the environment and water quality testing remains a top priority having received an extra £8m in funding.\"\"Our water quality testing programme remains robust and prioritised on the basis of need - only a small proportion of tests were impacted by this issue, with no impact on pollution incidents and bathing water testing.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx24xy8zgp4o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_date": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 03:12:14 GMT", "source": "bbc", "topic": "climate-change-policy", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:28.161862", "word_count": 771}
{"title": "Carney 'disappointed' as Trump increases tariffs on Canada to 35%", "content": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said he is \"disappointed\" by an increased tariff on some exports to the United States. US President Donald Trump escalated a trade war by boosting the tariff rate from 25% to 35%, saying that Canada had \"failed to cooperate\" in curbing the flow of fentanyl and other drugs across the US border. The Canadian government says it is cracking down on drug gangs. However most goods from Canada will dodge the import tax imposed by the US thanks to an existing trade treaty, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).Trump also announced sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, as he continued his drive to remake global trade. Follow live coverage hereHow much cash is the US raising from tariffs? Economists and financial analysts have warned that the new levies will raise prices for businesses and consumers in the US and weigh on the economy, predictions that the Trump administration has dismissed.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday that Trump was \"proving the so-called economic experts wrong at every turn\".\"What we are watching is President Trump rebuilding the greatest economy in the history of the world,\" she said.Most countries affected by the so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs will have seven days before they kick in.Goods that are loaded onto ships by 7 August and those that are already in transit will also not be affected by the rates if they reach the US before 5 October.Published by the White House, the orders leave most goods coming into the US facing new import taxes of between 10% and 50%.Few nations have been spared in the latest list of tariff rates. Even small economies like Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea in the Asia-Pacific region were issued 15% duties.Countries not mentioned on the list face baseline duties of 10%.The headline new tariff for Canada seems severe but nearly 90% of Canadian goods imported into the US are exempted under the free trade deal.That includes fresh produce, energy exports and many industrial goods, according to the Royal Bank of Canada.However, some imports like dairy products, wood and leather may still face tariffs depending on how talks shape up.The decision, contained in an executive order, increases the tariff rate from 25% and came into effect at 00:01 US Eastern time (05:01 BST) on Friday.As the clock ticked towards Trump's Friday deadline to strike trade deals, he announced goods from Mexico would be charged at current rates for another 90 days, avoiding a similar threatened increase from 25% to 35%. ANALYSIS: How much cash is the US raising from tariffs?EXPLAINER: What tariffs has Trump announced and why?CONSUMERS: Six things that will get more expensive for Americans However senior White House officials said their Canadian counterparts were less constructive in negotiations than Mexico, prompting the higher 35% tariff on Ottawa.Trump has cited matters other than trade in justification of higher rates on one of the closest US trading partners.Earlier this week, Carney said Canada would consider recognising a Palestinian state if certain conditions are met, a move that Trump said would make a trade deal \"very hard\". And in a statement Thursday the White House said \"Canada has failed to cooperate in curbing the ongoing flood of fentanyl and other illicit drugs\". Carney said Canada accounts for only about 1% of fentanyl imports into the US and is making \"historic investments\" to crack down on drug gangs including thousands of new police and border patrol agents.Mary Ng, who until March 2025 was Canada's international trade minister, told the BBC that tariffs would push Canada to continue to seek out trade opportunities with other countries.\"We have a very integrated supply chain between Canada and the United States, built over decades,\" she said. \"But Canada has already made a decision… about reducing our reliance and overdependence on the United States.\"\"There are markets beyond the United States,\" Ng said. The tariffs hit Asian countries hard.Two major trading partners in the region - India and Taiwan - were hit with levies of 25% and 20% respectively.Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te said the levy was only \"temporary\", vowing to complete talks with Washington for a deal. Taiwan had faced an initial charge of 32% when tariff rates were initially announced in April.And land-locked South East Asian nation Laos is facing the second-highest rate in this round of tariffs. At 40% it sits just behind Syria's unenviable 41%.Trump tariffs on Asia: Which economies were hit hardest?The US has however reached a deal with South Korea, imposing a lower 15% tariff on its imports in return for investment in the US and other concessions. The escalation of the tariffs had been telegraphed for months, starting when Trump unveiled sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs in April, saying they would rebalance global trade flows and reduce America's trade deficit - the gap between what it buys and sells abroad.  The measures added to separate levies targeting key sectors such as steel, aluminium and cars. After turmoil in financial markets, he suspended some of the most punishing measures, inviting countries to negotiate, while leaving in place a 10% duty on most products. More than 200 countries reached out to the White House in the months following, according to Trump administration officials, though some struggled to get attention.Trump officials ultimately reached rough \"framework\" agreements with eight trade partners, including the UK, China, Japan and European Union, which set tariff rates in exchange for promises of investment in the US or other concessions.But key aspects of those agreements remain unresolved. Talks with other countries such as India ended without terms. Trump says that in addition to a 25% rate, India will an unspecified \"penalty\" for its dealings with Russia. Up until nearly the last moment, many countries were still waiting word on what new tariff rates the administration had settled on.In a post on social media, Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter said she had a last-minute phone call with Trump, which ended without an accord. \"The trade deficit remains a central concern of his,\" she wrote. Switzerland ended up with a 39% tariff.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8deqejdrmro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_date": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 10:06:25 GMT", "source": "bbc", "topic": "economic-inflation", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:28.819922", "word_count": 1004}
{"title": "Trump's global tariffs 'victory' may well come at a high price", "content": "In April Donald Trump stunned the world by announcing sweeping new import tariffs – only to put most on hold amid the resulting global financial panic.Four months later, the US president is touting what he claims are a series of victories, having unveiled a handful of deals with trading partners and unilaterally imposed tariffs on others, all without the kind of massive disruptions to the financial markets that his spring attempt triggered.At least, so far.Having worked to reorder America's place in the global economy, Trump is now promising that the US will reap the benefits of new revenue, rekindle domestic manufacturing, and generate hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign investment and purchases.Whether that turns out to be the case – and whether these actions will have negative consequences – is still very much in doubt.What is clear so far, however, is that a tide that was (gently) turning on free trade, even ahead of Trump's second term, has become a wave crashing across the globe. And while it is reshaping the economic landscape, it hasn't left the kind of wreckage in its wake that some might have predicted - though of course there is often a lag before impact is fully seen. What's more, for many countries, this has all served as a wake up call - a need to remain alive to fresh alliances.And so, while the short term result might be - as Trump sees it - a victory, the impact on his overarching goals is far less certain. As are the long-term repercussions, which could well pan out rather differently for Trump - or the America he leaves behind after his current term. For all the wrong reasons, 1 August had been ringed on international policymakers' calendars. Agree new trading terms with the US by then, they'd been warned – or face potentially ruinous tariffs.While White House trade adviser Peter Navarro predicted \"90 deals in 90 days\" and Trump offered an optimistic outlook on reaching agreements, the deadline always appeared to be a tall order. And it was.By the time the end of July rolled around, Trump had only announced about a dozen trade deals – some no more than a page or two long, without the kind of detailed provisions standard in past negotiations. The UK was first off the blocks, perhaps inevitably. Trump's biggest bugbear is, after all, America's trade deficit, and trade is in broad balance when it comes to the UK.While the baseline 10% applied to most British goods may initially have raised eyebrows, it provided a hint of what was to follow – and in the end came as a relief compared to the 15% rate applied to other trading partners such as the EU and Japan, with whom the US has larger deficits; $240bn and $70bn respectively last year alone.And even those agreements came with strings attached. Those countries that weren't able to commit to, say, buying more American goods, often faced higher tariffs.South Korea, Cambodia, Pakistan - as the list grew, and tariff letters were fired off elsewhere, the bulk of American imports are now covered by either an agreement or a presidential decree concluded with a curt \"thank you for your attention to this matter\". Much has been revealed as a result of this.First, the good news. The wrangling of the last few months means the most painful of tariffs, and recession warnings, have been dodged. The worst fears – in terms of tariff levels and potential economic fallout (for the US and elsewhere) - have not been realised. Second, the agreement of tariff terms, however unpalatable, reduced much of the uncertainty (itself wielded by Trump as a powerful economic weapon) for better - and for worse.For better, in the sense that businesses are able to make plans, investment and hiring decisions that had been paused may now be resumed. Most exporters know what size tariffs their goods face – and can figure out how to accommodate or pass on the cost to consumers.That growing sense of certainty underpins a more relaxed mood in financial markets, with shares in the US notably gaining. But it's for the worse, in the sense that the typical tariff for selling into the US is higher than before – and more extreme than analysts predicted just six months ago.Trump may have hailed the size of the agreement of the US with the EU – but these are not the tariff-busting deals we equated with tearing down trade barriers in previous decades.The greatest fears, the warnings of potential disaster, have receded. But Ben May, Director of global macro forecasting at Oxford Economics, says that US tariffs had the capacity to \"damage\" the global economy in several ways.\"They are obviously raising prices in the US and squeezing household incomes,\" he says, adding that the policies would also reduce demand around the world if the world's largest economy ends up importing fewer goods. It's not just about the size of tariff, but the scale of trading relationship with the US. So while India potentially faces tariffs of over 25% on its exports to the US, economists at Capital Economics reckon that, with US demand accounting for just 2% of that nation's gross domestic product, the immediate impact on growth could be minor.The news is not so good for Germany, though, where the 15% tariffs could knock more than half a percentage point off growth this year, compared to what was expected earlier in the year.That's due to the size of its automotive sector - unhelpful for an economy that may be teetering on the brink of recession. Meanwhile, India became the top source of smartphones sold in the US in the last few months, after fears of what may lie in store for China prompted Apple to shift production.On the other hand, India will be mindful that the likes of Vietnam and the Philippines – which face lower tariffs when selling to the US – may become relatively more attractive suppliers in other industries.Across the board, however, there's relief that the blow, at least, is likely to be less extensive than might have been. But what has been decided already points to longer-term ramifications for global trading patterns and alliances elsewhere.And the element of jeopardy introduced into a long-established major relationship with the US, lent added momentum to the UK's pursuit of closer ties with the EU – and getting a trade deal with India over the line.For many countries, this has served as a wake up call - a need to remain alive to fresh alliances. As details are nailed down, the implications for the US economy become clearer too.Growth in the late spring there actually benefitted from a flurry of export sales, as businesses rushed to beat any higher tariffs imposed on American goods. Economists expect that growth to lose momentum over the rest of the year. Tariffs that have increased from an average of 2% at the beginning of the year to around 17% now have had a notable impact on US government revenue – one of the stated goals of Trump's trade policy. Import duties have brought in more than $100bn so far this year - about 5% of US federal revenue, compared to around 2% in past years. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expected tariff revenue this year to total about $300bn. By comparison, federal income taxes bring in around $2.5tn a year.American shoppers remain in the front line, and have yet to see higher prices passed on in full. But as consumer goods giants such as Unilever and Adidas start to put numbers on the cost increases involved, some sticker shock, price rises, loom – potentially enough to delay Trump's desired rate cut – and possibly a dent to consumer spending. Forecasts are always uncertain, of course, but this represents a very real political threat for a president who promised to lower consumer prices, not take actions that would raise them.Trump and other White House officials have floated the idea of providing rebate checks to lower-income Americans – the kinds of blue-collar voters who have fuelled the president's political success – that would offset some of the pocketbook pain.Such an effort could be unwieldy, and it would require congressional approval.It's also a tacit acknowledgment that simply boasting of new federal revenue to offset current spending and tax cuts, and holding out the prospect of future domestic job and wealth creation is politically perilous for a Republican party that will have to face voters in next year's midterm state and congressional midterm elections. Complicating all this is the fact that there are many places where a deal is yet to be hammered out – most notably Canada and Taiwan. The US administration has yet to pronounce its decisions for the pharmaceuticals and steel industry. The colossal issue of China, subject to a different deadline, remains unresolved.Trump agreed to a negotiating extension with Mexico, another major US trading partner, on Thursday morning.Many of the deals that have been struck have been verbal, as yet unsigned. Moreover it is uncertain if and how the strings attached to Trump's agreements – more money to be spent purchasing American energy or invested in America – will actually be delivered on.In some cases, foreign leaders have denied the existence of provisions touted by the president. When it comes to assessing tariff agreements between the White House and various countries, says Mr May, the \"devil is in the detail\" – and the details are light.It's clear, however, that the world has shifted back from the brink of a ruinous trade war. Now, as nations grapple with a new set of trade barriers, Trump aims to call the shots.But history tells us that his overarching aim - to return production and jobs to America – may meet with very limited success. And America's long-time trading partners, like Canada and the EU, could start looking to form economic and political connections that bypass what they no longer view as a reliable economic ally.Trump may be benefitting from the leverage afforded by America's unique position at the centre of a global trading order that it spent more than half a century establishing. If the current tariffs trigger a foundational realignment, however, the results may not ultimately break in favour of the US.Those questions will be answered over years, not weeks or months. In the meantime, Trump's own voters may still have to pick up the tab – through higher prices, less choice and slower growth.Additional reporting: Michael Race.

{"title": "Car finance compensation landmark ruling due", "content": "A ruling by the UK's most senior judges later could pave the way for millions of motorists to claim compensation for motor finance mis-selling.The Supreme Court will decide whether or not to uphold an earlier ruling which found that hidden commission payments to car dealers were unlawful.Around nine in 10 new cars are bought on finance, so a decision could lead to billions of pounds being claimed by people who bought cars over many years.But the industry says it did nothing wrong, leaving lenders, drivers and the government waiting for clarity from the Supreme Court later. Many thousands of car buyers are already in line for payouts, but this case could widen the pool of potential claimants significantly.Major lenders, such as Lloyds, have set aside huge amounts of money in preparation for such a scenario, with the possibility of payouts approaching the levels seen during the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal.The car finance sector is the second biggest lender to consumers in the UK, with people only borrowing more in mortgages. The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements. Motorists put down a deposit, borrow the rest as a loan, and drive off in their new vehicle.Dealers were signing up customers to these finance deals and, behind the scenes, were paid a commission by lenders.Some dealers were paid more in commission if they secured a higher interest rate on the loan. These were known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) and were banned by regulators in 2021.Car loan scandal payouts row - what's it about? The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is likely to set up a central compensation scheme for those drivers who were mis-sold loans that had DCAs. However, some - like Jemma Caffrey, from Blackburn - want to take their cases to court, to pursue the prospect of a bigger payout.The 42-year-old bought a car in 2009 on her first day back at work after maternity leave. Her son was born with difficulties so she needed a car to get to work and multiple medical appointments, because it was impossible on public transport.\"I feel I was taken advantage of as a vulnerable new mum,\" she said.She paid a high interest rate for the blue Corsa. It was not until years later, having read about car finance in the local press that she went to Courmacs Legal to bring a claim.Like many other cases, that is now on hold pending the Supreme Court ruling. The Supreme Court is considering whether nearly all hidden commission arrangements were unlawful - not just DCAs.Judges are considering three test cases, including that of Marcus Johnson, 34-year-old, from Cwmbran, Torfaen.Mr Johnson said when he bought a blue Suzuki Swift in 2017 he simply did not know that the commission had been paid, although the lender said he had signed a document.The solicitors in these three cases say that the commissions amounted to bribes at common law.At the heart of this case is the duty of the motor dealer. When selling the car, the dealer is trying to seal the best deal for the business.But the Court of Appeal effectively said that, when the dealer then became a broker for the loan, it had a duty to act solely in the best interests of the buyer, not the lender. The car finance sector insists it complied with the law as it was understood, and as regulation required.The Finance and Leasing Association, the trade body for the motor finance sector, has said it wants the Supreme Court to provide what the rules are permanently for the future.The FCA said it would announce whether and how it would proceed with a compensation scheme within six weeks of the judgement.In February, the Supreme Court rejected an unusual intervention from the government, which was worried huge amounts of redress payments could upset the car market and make it less competitive, as well as making the UK less attractive to investors.The Treasury has said it wants to see a \"balanced judgement\" that delivers compensation proportionate to losses that consumers have suffered and allows the motor finance sector to continue supporting millions of motorists to own vehicles.It has been concerned this case is deterring investment in the UK, and hitting economic growth.Stuart Masson, editor of The Car Expert UK, said that if lenders have to pay compensation to millions of people, car finance could get more expensive in the future as the industry tries to \"claw back\" that money.\"That's not money they're going to find down the back of the sofa,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\"They're going to have to get that back from increasing the costs of future lending which won't just be on car finance. It could be on credit cards, it could be on personal loans, it could be on mortgages.\"However, Bobby Dean, a Liberal Democrat MP and member of the Treasury Committee, who has questioned lenders and others on this topic, said growth was not in competition with fairness and redress for consumers.\"Good regulation can make sure that consumers are protected and have confidence to buy things like car loans and that's the best thing we can do for the economy,\" he said. We will bring you live reporting of the judgement as soon as we get it followed by expert analysis on what it means for millions of drivers.

{"title": "Do you feel lucky plank? Meet the new 'bulletproof' wood", "content": "Could your house take a bullet for you?Clad it with a new type of modified wood, and it might, says Alex Lau, co-founder and executive chairman of InventWood.The US-based company has developed Superwood - a modified wood it claims is stronger than steel.During lab tests, a gas gun fired a bullet-like projectile at thin pieces of wood, including an early version of the company's product.While the projectile blasted straight through the natural wood, it failed to penetrate the heavily modified version.Mr Lau suggests that the product could have military applications, such as in battlefield shelters, but admits they \"haven't tried dropping bombs on it\". In the race to decarbonise construction, materials such as concrete – associated with high greenhouse gas emissions – are coming under ever-greater scrutiny.Wood-based construction, proponents say, can actually help in the fight against climate change by storing large amounts of carbon long-term.But natural timber is not always strong enough for certain applications and it can degrade when exposed to moisture or wood-gobbling insects.That's where engineered wood products come in. They promise to be significantly stronger and more resilient – reliable enough, even, to form the structural frames of skyscrapers. The construction industry is increasingly pushing wood to new limits.\"You can almost massage the wood so you're squeezing air and imperfections out,\" explains Mr Lau as he describes the process of treating timber with chemicals to remove lignin, a polymer found in wood, and then compressing it extremely firmly to reduce its volume by around 80%.This has the effect of creating additional hydrogen bonds within the material, adds Mr Lau, significantly strengthening it even though it becomes much thinner than the original timber.A key advantage, InventWood says, is in retaining the wood's attractive grain in the finished product. InventWood has spent years refining its process – it used to take more than a week. Now, staff can make a piece of Superwood in hours.The company will use wood from poplar trees initially but Mr Lau says it's also possible to use bamboo.\"We can grow suitable bamboo feedstock in like three or four years,\" he says. \"It's really an efficient way to draw down carbon from the atmosphere.\"There are already a range of engineered and modified wood products on the market. Take glulam, or glue-laminated timber, in which layers of wood with the grain facing in the same direction are glued together to make strong, moisture-resistant beams.Cross-laminated timber (CLT), meanwhile, involves stacking layers of wood with the grain in alternating directions, to make panels for walls and floors. Like an ultra-tough plywood.Using CLT instead of concrete to build a community centre could reduce carbon emissions associated with the construction and operation of the building by nearly 10%, a study published in June suggested.Superwood isn't designed to compete with these products, says Mr Lau. But it could provide a more aesthetically pleasing, and structurally sound, finishing layer to them, for example. Or, it could function as a durable external cladding.It's a \"promising\" technology, says Morwenna Spear, research fellow at Bangor University's BioComposites Centre.Though she points out that, in environments such as the UK, wood that is used externally on buildings must cope with weather that cycles from wet to dry extremely frequently. \"I'd want to see some data coming from them about that,\" she says. Other companies are working on different engineered wood products.Pollmeier in Germany, for example, has BauBuche – a laminated veneer lumber, very thin layers of wood pressed and glued together – made using beech. That's interesting because beech is not generally considered the first choice for construction.\"By processing it into veneers, Pollmeier found a way to use it much more structurally,\" explains Michael Ramage, director of the Centre for Natural Material Innovation at the University of Cambridge.There's also 3RT in Australia, which uses thin veneer sheets of low-value trees or \"pulp logs\".It allows them to mimic the structure and density of much more valuable hardwood. The product has recently been used in large window frames and also to make kitchen cabinets, furniture and the treads of internal staircases.With so many wood products emerging, Dr Spear says that architects and designers today have much more choice in terms of how they use wood in a building.\"It may be that we think of these new products almost as pseudo-species,\" she says. \"It just increases that palette of options to people.\" There are still barriers to wood in construction, though, says Prof Ramage: \"Is the mortgage the same rate as a mortgage on a concrete building? Is the insurance the same price?\"He advocates for the wider adoption of wood products chiefly because of their ability to store carbon over many years, though he notes that there are some jobs wood can't do. \"We're always going to need concrete in the ground for foundations,\" he says.Mr Lau points out that, after the devastating wildfires that hit Los Angeles in January, some people have questioned the wisdom of using wood as a building material. But he insists that Superwood has proved fire-resistant in tests.Separately, the wood has also survived exposure to wood-eating insects, adds Mr Lau. While it is tougher to work with than natural timber, it can still be sawn in a traditional manner with carbide or diamond-tipped blades.We shouldn't forget the importance of recycling old timber amidst the rise of highly engineered wood products, though, says Dr Spear. Researchers in the UK have shown that waste wood from demolished buildings can be repurposed in CLT-style panels.Plus, you probably already have a significant number of recycled wood products in your own home, demonstrating that novel ways of using wood really have become quite mainstream these days. \"So much of our furniture is made… of particle board – a huge proportion of that comes from recycled timber,\" says Dr Spear.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rvzdd1drpo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_date": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 23:03:52 GMT", "source": "bbc", "topic": "economic-inflation", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:30.559183", "word_count": 960}
{"title": "Heathrow Airport's expansion plans to cost £49bn", "content": "Heathrow Airport has revealed details of its plan to expand and modernise the airport at a cost of £49bn. Thomas Woldbye, CEO of Heathrow Airport, said expansion was \"urgent\" as the airport was currently working at capacity, \"to the detriment of trade and connectivity\". The work would be funded by private finance.The government has backed plans for a third runway, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves saying it would \"make Britain the world's best connected place to do business\".However, the plans face opposition from environmental groups, politicians, and locals. London's mayor Sir Sadiq Khan said it would have a \"severe impact on noise, air pollution and meeting our climate change targets\". The plans come a day after the deadline set by the government for parties to submit proposals.Heathrow's plans, which it estimates would be completed within a decade, include:Creation of a third runway, called the \"North-Western Runway\", which would be up to 3,500m (11,500 ft) long. Heathrow bosses say this will increase capacity to 756,000 flights and 150m passengers a year - it currently serves about 84mA new terminal called T5X, expanding Terminal 2 and three new satellite terminals. It would close Terminal 3Enhancement of local rail connections, plus walking and cycling routesDiversion of the M25, which would involve a new road tunnel under the airport, and widening the motorway between junctions 14-15Creation of two new Heathrow parkways Improvements to Heathrow's bus and coach stations.Heathrow said it would cost £21bn to build the third runway, which includes procuring the land, changing the M25 and other associated infrastructure costs while building the new terminal would be £12bn and modernising the current airport's infrastructure £15bn. Due to rounding, it will total £49bn.A spokesperson added the plans would grow the UK economy by 0.43% GDP. The plans revealed by Heathrow were welcomed by business groups and airline companies. A joint statement from the Confederation of British Industry, British Chambers of Commerce, MakeUK, Federation of Small Businesses and Institute of Directors, said it was \"an investment in the nation's future\".It added: \"The benefits are clear: for exporters, it opens up vital access to major and emerging markets; for visitors, it enhances global and domestic connectivity; and for businesses, it unlocks billions in private investment, strengthening supply chains, creating jobs, and driving skills across the country.\"John Dickie, chief executive of BusinessLDN, said as the airport was currently operating at full capacity, the expansion would give businesses \"better connectivity to overseas markets and support Britain's growth\".He added it would also help achieve the government's target of 50 million international visitors per year to the UK. Mr Woldbye said Heathrow's submission was in line with the aviation industry's target to be net zero by 2050. He added that Heathrow was \"the airport in the world with the highest uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuel\", and that planning permission would not be granted by government unless legal limits of emissions were adhered to. However, the plans were heavily criticised by groups who called the environmental justifications for the plans as \"hopeful marketing spin\". Dr Douglas Parr, policy director for Greenpeace UK, said the government had \"decided yet again to prioritise more leisure opportunities for a comparatively small group of frequent fliers, whilst the rest of us have to live with the consequences of their disproportionate polluting\".He suggested a \"frequent flier levy\", and said no expansion should take place until there was a solution to the \"pollution problem\". His concerns were echoed by politicians including Sir Sadiq who said he remained \"unconvinced\" that hundreds of thousands of additional flights each year would not have a \"hugely detrimental\" impact.He added City Hall would \"carefully scrutinise\" the impact the extension would have on people living in the area and the \"huge knock-on effects for our transport infrastructure, which would require a comprehensive and costed plan to manage\". Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the applications that have come in \"will include investment in the infrastructure, for example, the changes around the M25 to make airport expansion necessary\".She added: \"Airport expansion is essential if we're going to seize the opportunities, and this government are absolutely determined to seize the opportunities that come from being an open trading economy.\"Asked about the mayor of London's objections, Reeves said: \"These are decisions the national government make, and this Labour government backs Heathrow expansion, backs the third runway at Heathrow.\" Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrat MP for Twickenham, said Heathrow is already the single largest polluter in the UK.She added: \"The Climate Change Committee itself has said expansion would put the UK's climate goals at risk.\"It's also clear we can't rely on the silver bullet of Sustainable Aviation Fuels to save the day.\"Green Party deputy leader, Zack Polankski, said the plans were being delivered \"regardless\" of the environmental impact. \"If Labour's environmental commitments were worth the paper they're written on, these proposals would never have seen the light of day,\" he said.Local residents living in Harmondsworth, near the airport, told the BBC earlier this year a third of the village would be destroyed if a third runway was to go ahead. Heathrow's plans follow the publication of a rival proposal by the Arora Group, which has outlined a way to expand the airport without needing to redirect the M25. Owner of the group, hotel tycoon Surinder Arora, said the creation of a third runway and a new terminal, under his plans, had a cost estimate of under £25bn, not including the redevelopment of the airport's existing central area.The proposal crucially does not involve an expensive alteration to the M25, as the group said it was possible to build a 2,800-metre (9,200 ft) third runway instead of the full-length 3,500-metre (11,500 ft) runway planned by the airport.Arora Group said its plan, called Heathrow West, could have a new runway fully operational by 2035, while a new terminal would open in two phases, in 2036 and 2040. When asked about the added expense of altering the M25 to accommodate a new, third runway, Heathrow's CEO said: \"The whole conversation about the M25 has been slightly exaggerated\", and that disruption to drivers would be minimal. \"We will build a new and much better M25, 100m (330 ft) to the west of the current one. It will be wider and it will be safer and it will have more capacity,\" Mr Woldbye added. He said plans to create a much shorter runway to avoid moving the M25 - like the one proposed by The Aurora Group - would \"not provide the capacity that we and the airlines need\", but said the airport would be open to a discussion with airlines about building a shorter runway if it could deliver the same benefits. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said the two proposals were a \"significant step towards unlocking growth, creating jobs, and delivering vital national infrastructure\".\"We'll consider the proposals carefully over the summer so that we can begin a review of the Airports National Policy Statement later this year,\" she added.The London Borough of Hillingdon, which contains the whole of Heathrow, reiterated its opposition to expansion, calling the airport's plan \"a glossy pitch\".It said Heathrow's claims of full private funding \"don't stand up to scrutiny - the public would ultimately bear the cost of tunnelling the M25, surface access works, and noise mitigation\". BBC London's political editor Karl Mercer said: \"History has not been kind to plans to build a third runway, whoever has put them forward, and whichever colour government is in power.\"Gordon Brown's Labour government supported Heathrow expansion in 2009 - that didn't happen. \"Then during Conservative Theresa May's reign in 2018, MPs voted overwhelmingly in support of a third runway - only for a series of court challenges and then Covid to put an end to those plans. \"There are plenty of Labour MPs in the capital who are still strongly opposed to expansion  - 28 voted against it last time and most are still in the House. \"Having bidders interested is only half the battle - the hardest half will be getting it delivered.\" Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

{"title": "Trump's global tariffs 'victory' may well come at a high price", "content": "In April Donald Trump stunned the world by announcing sweeping new import tariffs – only to put most on hold amid the resulting global financial panic.Four months later, the US president is touting what he claims are a series of victories, having unveiled a handful of deals with trading partners and unilaterally imposed tariffs on others, all without the kind of massive disruptions to the financial markets that his spring attempt triggered.At least, so far.Having worked to reorder America's place in the global economy, Trump is now promising that the US will reap the benefits of new revenue, rekindle domestic manufacturing, and generate hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign investment and purchases.Whether that turns out to be the case – and whether these actions will have negative consequences – is still very much in doubt.What is clear so far, however, is that a tide that was (gently) turning on free trade, even ahead of Trump's second term, has become a wave crashing across the globe. And while it is reshaping the economic landscape, it hasn't left the kind of wreckage in its wake that some might have predicted - though of course there is often a lag before impact is fully seen. What's more, for many countries, this has all served as a wake up call - a need to remain alive to fresh alliances.And so, while the short term result might be - as Trump sees it - a victory, the impact on his overarching goals is far less certain. As are the long-term repercussions, which could well pan out rather differently for Trump - or the America he leaves behind after his current term. For all the wrong reasons, 1 August had been ringed on international policymakers' calendars. Agree new trading terms with the US by then, they'd been warned – or face potentially ruinous tariffs.While White House trade adviser Peter Navarro predicted \"90 deals in 90 days\" and Trump offered an optimistic outlook on reaching agreements, the deadline always appeared to be a tall order. And it was.By the time the end of July rolled around, Trump had only announced about a dozen trade deals – some no more than a page or two long, without the kind of detailed provisions standard in past negotiations. The UK was first off the blocks, perhaps inevitably. Trump's biggest bugbear is, after all, America's trade deficit, and trade is in broad balance when it comes to the UK.While the baseline 10% applied to most British goods may initially have raised eyebrows, it provided a hint of what was to follow – and in the end came as a relief compared to the 15% rate applied to other trading partners such as the EU and Japan, with whom the US has larger deficits; $240bn and $70bn respectively last year alone.And even those agreements came with strings attached. Those countries that weren't able to commit to, say, buying more American goods, often faced higher tariffs.South Korea, Cambodia, Pakistan - as the list grew, and tariff letters were fired off elsewhere, the bulk of American imports are now covered by either an agreement or a presidential decree concluded with a curt \"thank you for your attention to this matter\". Much has been revealed as a result of this.First, the good news. The wrangling of the last few months means the most painful of tariffs, and recession warnings, have been dodged. The worst fears – in terms of tariff levels and potential economic fallout (for the US and elsewhere) - have not been realised. Second, the agreement of tariff terms, however unpalatable, reduced much of the uncertainty (itself wielded by Trump as a powerful economic weapon) for better - and for worse.For better, in the sense that businesses are able to make plans, investment and hiring decisions that had been paused may now be resumed. Most exporters know what size tariffs their goods face – and can figure out how to accommodate or pass on the cost to consumers.That growing sense of certainty underpins a more relaxed mood in financial markets, with shares in the US notably gaining. But it's for the worse, in the sense that the typical tariff for selling into the US is higher than before – and more extreme than analysts predicted just six months ago.Trump may have hailed the size of the agreement of the US with the EU – but these are not the tariff-busting deals we equated with tearing down trade barriers in previous decades.The greatest fears, the warnings of potential disaster, have receded. But Ben May, Director of global macro forecasting at Oxford Economics, says that US tariffs had the capacity to \"damage\" the global economy in several ways.\"They are obviously raising prices in the US and squeezing household incomes,\" he says, adding that the policies would also reduce demand around the world if the world's largest economy ends up importing fewer goods. It's not just about the size of tariff, but the scale of trading relationship with the US. So while India potentially faces tariffs of over 25% on its exports to the US, economists at Capital Economics reckon that, with US demand accounting for just 2% of that nation's gross domestic product, the immediate impact on growth could be minor.The news is not so good for Germany, though, where the 15% tariffs could knock more than half a percentage point off growth this year, compared to what was expected earlier in the year.That's due to the size of its automotive sector - unhelpful for an economy that may be teetering on the brink of recession. Meanwhile, India became the top source of smartphones sold in the US in the last few months, after fears of what may lie in store for China prompted Apple to shift production.On the other hand, India will be mindful that the likes of Vietnam and the Philippines – which face lower tariffs when selling to the US – may become relatively more attractive suppliers in other industries.Across the board, however, there's relief that the blow, at least, is likely to be less extensive than might have been. But what has been decided already points to longer-term ramifications for global trading patterns and alliances elsewhere.And the element of jeopardy introduced into a long-established major relationship with the US, lent added momentum to the UK's pursuit of closer ties with the EU – and getting a trade deal with India over the line.For many countries, this has served as a wake up call - a need to remain alive to fresh alliances. As details are nailed down, the implications for the US economy become clearer too.Growth in the late spring there actually benefitted from a flurry of export sales, as businesses rushed to beat any higher tariffs imposed on American goods. Economists expect that growth to lose momentum over the rest of the year. Tariffs that have increased from an average of 2% at the beginning of the year to around 17% now have had a notable impact on US government revenue – one of the stated goals of Trump's trade policy. Import duties have brought in more than $100bn so far this year - about 5% of US federal revenue, compared to around 2% in past years. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expected tariff revenue this year to total about $300bn. By comparison, federal income taxes bring in around $2.5tn a year.American shoppers remain in the front line, and have yet to see higher prices passed on in full. But as consumer goods giants such as Unilever and Adidas start to put numbers on the cost increases involved, some sticker shock, price rises, loom – potentially enough to delay Trump's desired rate cut – and possibly a dent to consumer spending. Forecasts are always uncertain, of course, but this represents a very real political threat for a president who promised to lower consumer prices, not take actions that would raise them.Trump and other White House officials have floated the idea of providing rebate checks to lower-income Americans – the kinds of blue-collar voters who have fuelled the president's political success – that would offset some of the pocketbook pain.Such an effort could be unwieldy, and it would require congressional approval.It's also a tacit acknowledgment that simply boasting of new federal revenue to offset current spending and tax cuts, and holding out the prospect of future domestic job and wealth creation is politically perilous for a Republican party that will have to face voters in next year's midterm state and congressional midterm elections. Complicating all this is the fact that there are many places where a deal is yet to be hammered out – most notably Canada and Taiwan. The US administration has yet to pronounce its decisions for the pharmaceuticals and steel industry. The colossal issue of China, subject to a different deadline, remains unresolved.Trump agreed to a negotiating extension with Mexico, another major US trading partner, on Thursday morning.Many of the deals that have been struck have been verbal, as yet unsigned. Moreover it is uncertain if and how the strings attached to Trump's agreements – more money to be spent purchasing American energy or invested in America – will actually be delivered on.In some cases, foreign leaders have denied the existence of provisions touted by the president. When it comes to assessing tariff agreements between the White House and various countries, says Mr May, the \"devil is in the detail\" – and the details are light.It's clear, however, that the world has shifted back from the brink of a ruinous trade war. Now, as nations grapple with a new set of trade barriers, Trump aims to call the shots.But history tells us that his overarching aim - to return production and jobs to America – may meet with very limited success. And America's long-time trading partners, like Canada and the EU, could start looking to form economic and political connections that bypass what they no longer view as a reliable economic ally.Trump may be benefitting from the leverage afforded by America's unique position at the centre of a global trading order that it spent more than half a century establishing. If the current tariffs trigger a foundational realignment, however, the results may not ultimately break in favour of the US.Those questions will be answered over years, not weeks or months. In the meantime, Trump's own voters may still have to pick up the tab – through higher prices, less choice and slower growth.Additional reporting: Michael Race.

{"title": "Trump envoy visits controversial Gaza aid distribution site", "content": "US President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff has for the first time visited a controversial Israel- and US-backed aid distribution site in Gaza.Witkoff said the purpose of the trip to a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) site was to give Trump \"a clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza\".The visit follows near daily reports of deadly shootings at GHF points, with the UN reporting at least 859 Palestinians killed in the vicinity of the sites - a figure the GHF rejects.Israel says its troops have only fired warning shots and that they do not intentionally shoot civilians. The BBC understands Witkoff visited one of the GHF sites near Rafah in southern Gaza on Friday.He was accompanied by US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).Posting on X afterwards, alongside pictures of their visit, Witkoff said: \"Today, we spent over five hours inside Gaza – level setting the facts on the ground, assessing conditions, and meeting with @GHFUpdates and other agencies.\"Huckabee said they had received \"briefings from the IDF and spoke to folks on the ground\". He claimed GHF sites were delivering \"more than one million meals a day\", calling it an \"incredible feat\". The GHF said it had delivered 1.3m meals across three distribution sites on Thursday. It has not yet released figures for Friday. The UN says the number of meals provided by the GHF falls far short of overall nutritional requirements.International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, making it difficult to verify claims. Some Gazans who spoke to the BBC denounced Witkoff's visit as a \"media stunt\".Louay Mahmoud, who lives in Gaza, said: \"Steve Witkoff won't see the hunger, only the narrative Israel wants him to see.\"This visit is a hollow media stunt, not a humanitarian mission. He comes with no solutions, only talking points designed to polish the image of an administration complicit in our suffering.\"Amer Khayrat, a father of two who lives in Gaza City, said: \"What Gaza needs isn't another envoy with a press team. We need the siege lifted, the bombing stopped, and the blind American support for this war brought to an end.\" A retired US special forces officer who worked at GHF centres told the BBC last week he witnessed IDF troops and US contractors shooting at crowds of Palestinians near sites he worked at.Lt Col Anthony Aguilar, a special forces veteran of the US Army's Green Berets, said he had never witnessed such a level of \"brutality and use of indiscriminate and unnecessary force against a civilian population, an unarmed, starving population\" in his entire career.The GHF has called Aguilar's allegations \"categorically false\", describing him as a \"disgruntled former contractor who was terminated for misconduct\", which he denies. On Friday campaign group Human Right Watch (HRW) accused Israeli forces and US-backed contractors of establishing \"a flawed, militarised aid distribution system that has turned aid distribution into regular bloodbaths\".HRW called for Israeli authorities \"to immediately stop using lethal force as crowd control against Palestinian civilians\" and called for the US and Israel to suspend the operation.GHF aid sites replaced the UN distribution mechanism in May, sparking international outrage. Israel accused Hamas of looting UN aid, a charge Hamas denies.There are four GHF sites, which are located inside Israeli military zones and are operated by US private security contractors.Eyewitnesses and medics have on several occasions described Israeli forces opening fire on crowds near the aid points.In addition, UN agencies have warned man-made, mass starvation is taking place in the territory. The UN's human rights office (OCHR) said on Thursday that at least 1,373 Palestinians had been killed while trying to get food aid in Gaza. Of those, 859 have been killed near GHF sites, it said.The OCHR said most were killed by the Israeli military, and while they were aware of other armed groups in the same area, it added that they \"do not have information indicating their involvement in these killings\".The office said it had \"no information that these Palestinians were directly participating in hostilities or posed any threat to Israeli security forces\".Israel has accused Hamas of instigating the chaos near the aid sites. The GHF rejected the UN's numbers when approached for comment by the BBC.Meanwhile, at least 10 people have been killed in southern and central Gaza since dawn on Friday, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency.The figure includes eight people who were killed in two separate Israeli air strikes targeting tents sheltering displaced people - in Khan Younis in the south and Deir al-Balah in the centre of the strip, the agency said.Two others were killed and at least 20 more injured when Israeli forces opened fire near an aid distribution point along the Morag corridor, north of Rafah, the civil defence added.Local residents said hundreds of people had gathered to get food when the shooting began.The BBC has approached the Israeli military for comment.The Hamas-run health ministry said on Friday 82 people had been killed in Gaza in the past 24 hours, 52 of whom were reported to be seeking aid. Witkoff met Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel on Thursday for what were described by a US spokesperson as \"productive\" talks.There were discussions of a major reformulation of the ceasefire negotiations, according to Israeli media reports, which include an \"all-in deal\" that would see all hostages held by Hamas released in a single exchange, alongside the full disarmament of Hamas. Previously, hostages were to be released in phases. Hamas has said it will not return to the table until more aid is allowed into Gaza to address starvation.The US and Israel pulled out of ceasefire talks last week, accusing Hamas of lacking coordination and not negotiating in good faith. Hamas accused the Israeli side of intransigence over key sticking points in the negotiations.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x5jnl5eygo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_date": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 14:35:38 GMT", "source": "bbc", "topic": "immigration-policy", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:32.333398", "word_count": 984}
{"title": "Zelensky demands tougher sanctions after Russian strikes kill 31 in Kyiv ", "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for stronger international sanctions on Russia after a deadly attack on Kyiv killed at least 31 people. Zelensky said five children - the youngest aged two - were among the dead and 159 people - including 16 children - had been wounded in the assault on the Ukrainian capital on Thursday.\"No matter how much the Kremlin denies their effectiveness, sanctions do work - and they must be strengthened,\" he said. Kyiv observed a day of mourning after the attack collapsed an apartment block and damaged a hospital, school, nursery and university. Russia launched more than 300 drones and eight cruise missiles in Thursday's assault, Ukraine's air force said. The attack was one of the deadliest Kyiv has experienced since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a large-scale invasion in February 2022.US President Donald Trump condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine and suggested new sanctions against Moscow were coming.\"Russia, I think it's disgusting what they're doing. I think it's disgusting,\" he told journalists.In July, Trump said Putin had 50 days to end the war, or Russia would face severe tariffs targeting its oil and other exports. On Monday, Trump set a new \"10 or 12\" day deadline. He later set a new deadline, which would expire on 8 August. Putin must agree Ukraine ceasefire in 10 or 12 days, says Trump Senior US diplomat John Kelley told the UN Security Council on Thursday that Russia and Ukraine \"must negotiate a ceasefire and durable peace\".\"It is time to make a deal,\" he said. Ukrainian officials on Friday said Kyiv had received \"positive signals\" from the US about potential new sanctions, particularly targeting Russian oil and secondary markets.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Trump has been \"generous and patient\", but that \"now is the time to put maximum pressure on Moscow\". Meanwhile, Germany pledged on Friday to deliver two additional US-made Patriot air defence systems in the coming days.Zelensky said in July alone, Russia launched more than 5,100 glide bombs, 3,800 Shahed drones, and 260 missiles, including 128 ballistic. \"Every day matters,\" he said. \"This can only be stopped through joint efforts – by America, Europe, and other global actors.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ypdxnz6k2o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_date": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 13:43:38 GMT", "source": "bbc", "topic": "immigration-policy", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:32.894567", "word_count": 361}
{"title": "Young Ukrainians get their way as Zelensky overturns law to defuse crisis", "content": "As Ukraine's MPs gathered at parliament in Kyiv on Thursday, some held cardboard signs that read, \"We are with our people.\"It was a message to thousands of young protesters who had taken part in the biggest anti-government demonstrations since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. They were out in force again on Thursday.The MPs then entered parliament, the Rada, and took part in a vote that overwhelmingly overturned a law introduced by President Volodymyr Zelensky last week that curtailed the independence of two key anti-corruption agencies known as Nabu and Sap -  the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office. The signs carried by the MPs outside the Rada were a nod to the placards carried by thousands of young people who had taken to the streets in towns and cities across Ukraine for almost a week.The protesters had demanded that Zelensky and his government \"take their hands off\" the two anti-corruption bodies, and threatened to continue to carry on until the government made a U-turn.Within days, it did. Zelensky's original bill had stripped the two bodies of their independent authority to decide who to prosecute in high-level corruption cases, giving that prerogative to the general prosecutor - a presidential appointee.For the placard-waving protesters, safeguarding the independence of Nabu and Sap was as crucial to their European future as the war against Russia was a matter of life and death for their country.In 2022, Kyiv was granted the coveted status of EU candidate country – but on condition it mounted a credible fight against corruption.For Ukraine's Western partners - donors and investors who pour money into the country through international assistance and funding programmes - the existence and independence of the two anti-corruption bodies are non-negotiable.And for Ukraine and its war-shattered economy, that external financial help is critical.It was only 10 days earlier that MPs had backed Zelensky's controversial law, and yet they voted on Thursday by 331 to 0 to overturn it. On both occasions they appeared to be following Zelensky's direction.\"Ukraine is a democracy - there are definitely no doubts,\" he said on social media. Many Ukrainians see the hand of Zelensky's right-hand man, Andriy Yermak, behind the president's recent choices.Yermak's position as head of the presidential office is not regulated by the constitution nor limited by any checks or balances. And questions are being asked about such a role in Ukraine's democracy.Safeguarding that democracy and Ukraine's course towards European integration were the key drivers for the young protesters, while their parents and friends were defending their country on the front lines.MPs did their best to show the problem was now solved, but this crisis has left behind an unpleasant aftertaste.It has brought into question Zelensky's dedication to the anti-corruption reforms.That he seemed ready to compromise on these reforms may have seriously dented the trust the EU put in him. Kyiv death tolls rises to 16 as wave of Russian strikes defies Trump demandZelensky backtracks on law after protestsUkrainecast: Can Zelensky recover from nationwide protests? Some made the link between the government's bid to curtail the independence of Nabu and Sap. Powerful figures in Zelensky's circle have come under scrutiny, with some either facing charges or investigation.Zelensky's move also came after the government rejected a candidate selected by an independent commission to head the Bureau for Economic Security - the main agency for investigating economic crimes in Ukraine.The official reason Oleksandr Tsyvinski didn't get the job was that he didn't get the security clearance from the security service, which is under the president's control.However, Tsyvinski is a well-regarded anti-corruption expert and the selection commission still wants him appointed.All these elements resulted in one of the biggest power crises for Zelensky's team since he came to power in 2019.Three-and-a-half years into the full-scale war, the risk of further such mis-steps could come at a significant cost.Next year, Ukraine's budget deficit could hit $13bn (£10bn), according to a National Bank estimate. Kyiv would not be able to continue fighting the war if it were to lose Western partners' support.Already, the EU has reduced some of its financial aid to Ukraine because the government has not kept up with promised reforms.Ukraine's young protesters appear to have understood that all too well, and were prepared to challenge their government in a country they chose to stay despite the deadly threat of Russian drone and missile attacks.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv0n0ky4xro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_date": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 21:19:39 GMT", "source": "bbc", "topic": "immigration-policy", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:33.500855", "word_count": 725}
{"title": "White House unveils plans for new $200m ballroom ", "content": "The White House has announced plans to build a $200m (£151m) new ballroom, fulfilling an often-repeated desire of US President Donald Trump. The new ballroom will be built alongside a \"modernised\" East Wing of the White House, which currently houses the offices of First Lady Melania Trump and other key White House posts. The money will be donated directly by Trump and other so-far anonymous donors, with work beginning in September, according to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Trump has repeatedly promised to build a \"beautiful\" ballroom at the White House, and in 2016 offered to pay $100m during Barack Obama's administration - which the then-President rejected. In a briefing for reporters at the White House on Thursday, Leavitt said that the \"much needed and exquisite addition\" to the White House will be approximately 90,000 sq ft (8,360 sq m) with a seating capacity of about 650.Many formal White House functions are held in the White House's East Room, which can seat approximately 200 people. The new ballroom, Leavitt added, would also eliminate the need for a \"large and unsightly tent\" to be installed for state dinners and other large events, which sometimes include world leaders. According to Leavitt, construction is expected to be completed \"long before\" the end of Trump's term in office in January 2029.\"The President and the Trump White House are fully committed to working with the appropriate organisations to preserving the special history of the White House, while building a beautiful ballroom that can be enjoyed by future administrations and generations of Americans to come,\" Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said in a statement. Renderings provided by the White House show that the ballroom will be similar architecturally to the rest of the White House, with a lavish interior including chandeliers and ornate columns. \"The White House has a history of expansion to accommodate the changing needs of the nation's chief executive,\" Leslie Greene Bowman, who has served under four presidents on the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, told the BBC.\"I hope and trust that any proposed changes will honor and preserve the existing walls that have witnessed so much history. They are precious vessels of our legacy as a democracy.\"Offices housed in the East Wing of the White House adjacent to the construction - including that of First Lady Melania Trump - will be temporarily re-located. President Trump has repeatedly voiced his wishes for a new ballroom as part of renovations to the White House, which has already seen the installation of two large flagpoles, new gold decorations in the Oval Office and the bulldozing and paving over of the famed Rose Garden. \"There's never been a President that's good at ballrooms,\" Trump said at an event at the White House on Thursday. \"I'm good at building things.\"Trump added that \"they've always had to get tents\" for large events at the White House, which he described as a disaster. \"It's not a pretty sight.\"Earlier this week during a Scotland meeting with European Council President Ursula Van der Leyen, Trump told her that \"we're building a great ballroom at the White House\"\"No president knew how to build a ballroom,\" Trump said while sitting in another ballroom at his Turnberry golf resort. \"I could take this one, drop it right down there, and it would be beautiful.\"In 2016, when on the campaign trail during the administration of Barack Obama, Trump famously offered to contribute $100m for the construction of a new ballroom for the White House to use to host events. At the time, then-Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that the suggestion was \"not something that was at all seriously considered\". \"I'm not sure that it would be appropriate to have a shiny gold Trump sign…on any part of the White House,\" Earnest told reporters.

{"title": "Some Gaza and Ukraine posts blocked under new age checks", "content": "Social media companies ​​are blocking wide-ranging content - including posts about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza - in an attempt to comply with the UK's new Online Safety Act, BBC Verify has found.The new legislation, which came into effect last Friday, imposes fines on social media companies and other websites which fail to protect under-18s from pornography, posts promoting self-harm, and other harmful content. In serious cases, services could be blocked in the UK.But BBC Verify found a range of public interest content, including parliamentary debates on grooming gangs, has been restricted on X and Reddit for those who have not completed age verification checks.Experts warn companies are risking stifling legitimate public debate by overapplying the law. Sandra Wachter, a professor of technology and regulation at the Oxford Internet Institute, expressed alarm at the restrictions and told BBC Verify that the new bill was \"not supposed to be used to suppress facts of public interest, even if uncomfortable\".Organisations can be fined up to £18m or 10% of their global revenue if they are found to have failed to stop harmful content appearing on their platforms. Under the act harmful content includes posts containing pornography, or any which encourage self-harm, eating disorders or promote violence.Professor Sonia Livingstone - an expert in children's digital rights at the London School of Economics - said that companies might \"get better over time at not blocking public interest content while also protecting children\" as the law beds in over time.Among the restricted content identified by BBC Verify was a video post on X which showed a man in Gaza looking for the dead bodies of his family buried among the rubble of destroyed buildings. The post was restricted despite not showing any graphic imagery or bodies at any point in the clip. X subsequently removed the warning after being approached by BBC Verify.When users who had not verified their age attempted to access the post they were met with a message reading: \"Due to local laws, we are temporarily restricting access to this content until X estimates your age.\" The same warning was experienced by users who attempted to view a video of a Shahed drone destroyed mid-flight in Ukraine. The Iranian-made drones, which are widely used by Russia in the full-scale invasion, are unmanned and nobody was injured or killed in the clip.Reddit has introduced similar restrictions. The platform, which hosts countless communities which discuss major news events, now requires age checks for some groups when users try to access them via search engines.Among the Reddit communities which have been restricted is one called R/UkraineConflict, a message board with 48,000 members that frequently posts footage of the war. Similar restrictions, which urge users to \"log in to confirm your age\", have been imposed on several pages which discuss the Israel-Gaza war and communities which focus on healthcare.Meanwhile, clips of parliamentary debates have also been swept up in the restrictions. A speech by Conservative MP Katie Lam, containing a graphic description of the rape of a minor by a grooming gang, is available to view without restriction on Parliament's official streaming website, ParliamentLive, but is restricted on X.Lam, who was elected in 2024, wrote on social media: \"The British state won't protect children from mass gang rape. But it will 'protect' adults from hearing about it.\" Another post restricted on X shared an image of Francisco de Goya's 19th-century painting entitled Saturn Devouring His Son. The striking work depicts the Greek myth of the Titan Cronus - known as Saturn by the Romans - eating one of his children in fear of a prophesy that one would overthrow him and has been described as depicting \"utter male fury\".The examples gathered by BBC Verify are largely focussed on X and Reddit, as they clearly flag age-restricted content. Meta has a different system whereby 'teen' profiles are a different type of account with parental control - making it harder for us to identify which content is age-restricted.It is unclear exactly how many posts commenting on debates of public interest are being restricted. X and Reddit did not respond to a request for comment.But Prof Livingstone noted that it was \"possible that the companies are over-blocking to undermine the Act\".X owner Elon Musk has been highly critical of the Online Safety Act. The billionaire has launched a stream of attacks against the legislation online and X suggested that it could dissuade companies from launching products in the UK.\"[The law's] purpose is suppression of the people,\" Musk wrote on X on Monday, before sharing several posts by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson which also opposed the law.Data suggests that the legislation could heavily impact adults in the UK. Large proportions of users - up to 37% on X and 59% on Reddit - access these platforms whilst logged out, according to data from the platforms. This means those users won't be age-verified and will experience the internet in the same way as children.The Department of Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) emphasised to BBC Verify that it was up to social media platforms themselves to decide how to implement the requirements of the act, but insisted that the risk-based approach must not \"censor political debate\".What the Online Safety Act is - and how to keep children safe onlineWhich sites will require age verification under new law?Ofcom investigates 34 porn sites over age checksOfcom, the UK media regulator tasked with enforcing the act, has warned that firms could face fines not only for failing to protect children, but also for breaching freedom of speech under the act.BBC Verify's analysis also suggested that the legislation had succeeded in blocking some harmful material online. Since Musk bought X, previously called Twitter, the platform has earned a reputation for being flooded with pornographic material, as well violent, antisemitic and racist posts.However, we found that violent and pornographic content was significantly restricted when using an account without age verification.The new obligations effectively puts firms in a position where they must comply with the law. Prof Livingstone suggested that they could still be in a period of \"working out how best\" to make judgements over the sort of content on their sites, which could be refined over time.But Prof Wachter said that the level of self-regulation afforded to tech companies in choosing how to comply with the Online Safety Act called for well-staffed moderation teams equipped with \"time, resources, expertise and nuance\" to effectively make decisions.She also noted that many major social media companies, such as X and Meta, have slimmed down their moderation teams in recent years or dissolved them completely.\"This trend is very worrying when opaque rules are now applied to make these take down decisions, especially in the current political climate,\" Prof Wachter said.

{"title": "Ofcom investigates 34 porn sites over age checks", "content": "Ofcom is investigating four companies, operating a total of 34 porn sites, over whether they are complying with its new age check requirements.The regulator said on Friday more than 6,000 sites allowing pornography and other adult content would start using \"highly effective\" tools to verify or estimate whether users were over or under the age of 18.But Ofcom says some sites may be ignoring its new rules - designed to stop children stumbling across porn or other content deemed harmful by lawmakers.It has opened formal probes into 8579 LLC, AVS Group Ltd, Kick Online Entertainment S.A. and Trendio Ltd, which it says have more than nine million monthly visitors combined across their sites. \"These companies have been prioritised based on the risk of harm posed by the services they operate and their user numbers,\" Ofcom said in a press release on Thursday.The regulator is already investigating a range of platforms over similar suspicions.It previously opened probes into online message board 4chan and porn provider First Time Videos LLC in June.Prior to that it launched formal investigations into an online suicide forum, file-sharing services and a company that runs a so-called \"nudifying\" site.\"We expect to make further enforcement announcements in the coming weeks and months,\" the regulator said.Technology Secretary Peter Kyle welcomed the announcement and said it \"goes to the very heart of what the Online Safety Act is here to do\".\"These laws have nothing to do with censorship or policing adults seeking to access legal content,\" he said.\"Those who suggest otherwise are playing politics with child safety and have no practical alternatives for protecting our children from content they should never see – content that can cause lasting, even fatal, damage.\" Since age verification requirements took effect on Friday, people in the UK have been asked to confirm their age across a range of different platforms including social media platforms Reddit and X.Spotify confirmed to the BBC on Wednesday that it may prompt people in the UK, among other locations including Australia, to confirm their age if accessing music videos rated 18+ by uploaders.The sweeping rules have prompted a backlash from some who see the requirements as an overreach or potential privacy concern.More than 400,000 people have now signed a petition calling for the repeal of the Online Safety Act - the law requiring age checks to stop children encountering adult content.The government said in response it has no plans to withdraw the law.Some have also criticised the effectiveness of Ofcom's implementation of UK age check requirements, and their potential circumvention using virtual private networks. Apps providing free VPNs - which allow people to disguise their location online, in order to access the web from a different location - topped free app download charts on Apple's App Store after the rules came into effect on Friday.Ofcom has defended the measures as no \"silver bullet\" but said they will help make the internet safer for children by reducing the chance of them \"stumbling across porn\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y2xx6z6eko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_date": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 12:29:13 GMT", "source": "bbc", "topic": "tech-regulation", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:35.806247", "word_count": 494}
{"title": "What screen time does to children's brains is more complicated than it seems", "content": "The other day, while I was doing some household chores, I handed my youngest child his dad's iPad to keep him entertained. But after a while I suddenly felt uneasy: I wasn't keeping a close eye on how long he had spent using it or what he was looking at. So I told him it was time to stop.A full-blown tantrum erupted. He kicked, he yelled, he clung to it and tried to push me away with the might of a furious under-five. Not my finest hour as a parent, admittedly, and his extreme reaction bothered me.My older children are navigating social media, virtual reality and online gaming, and sometimes that concerns me too. I hear them tease each other about needing to \"touch grass\" – disconnect from the tech and get outdoors.The late Steve Jobs, who was CEO of Apple when the firm released the iPad, famously didn't let his own children have them. Bill Gates has said he restricted his children's access to tech too. Screen time has become synonymous with bad news, blamed for rises in depression in young people, behavioural problems and sleep deprivation. The renowned neuroscientist Baroness Susan Greenfield went as far as to say that internet use and computer games can harm the adolescent brain. Back in 2013 she compared the negative effects of prolonged screen time to the early days of climate change: a significant shift that people weren't taking seriously.Plenty of people are taking it more seriously now. But warnings about the dark side might not tell the full story.An editorial in the British Medical Journal argued that Baroness Greenfield's claims around the brain were \"not based on a fair scientific appraisal of the evidence… and are misleading to parents and the public at large\". Now, another group of UK scientists claim that concrete scientific evidence on the downsides of screens is lacking. So have we got it wrong when it comes to worrying about our children and curbing their access to tablets and smartphones? Pete Etchells, a psychology professor at Bath Spa University, is one of the academics in the group arguing that the evidence is lacking. He has analysed hundreds of studies about screen time and mental health, along with large amounts of data about young people and their screen habits. In his book Unlocked: The Real Science of Screen Time, he argues that the science behind the headline-grabbing conclusions is a mixed bag and, in many cases, flawed.\"Concrete scientific evidence to back up stories about the terrible outcomes of screen time simply isn't there,\" he writes. Research published by the American Psychology Association in 2021 told a similar story. The 14 authors, from various universities around the world, analysed 33 studies published between 2015 and 2019. Screen use including smartphones, social media and video games played \"little role in mental health concerns\", they found.And while some studies have suggested blue light - such as that emitted by screens - makes it harder to drift off because it suppresses the hormone melatonin, a 2024 review of 11 studies from around the world found no overall evidence that screen light in the hour before bed makes it more difficult to sleep. One big problem is that most of the data on the subject of screen time relies heavily on \"self-reporting\", Prof Etchells points out. In other words, researchers simply ask young people how long they think they spent on their screens, and how they remember it making them feel.He also argues there are millions of possible ways to interpret these large amounts of data. \"We have to be careful about looking at correlation,\" he says. He cites the example of a statistically significant rise in both ice cream sales and skin cancer symptoms during the summer. Both are related to warmer weather but not to each other: ice creams do not cause skin cancer. He also recalls a research project inspired by a GP who noticed two things: first, they were having more conversations with young people about depression and anxiety, and second, lots of young people were using phones in waiting rooms.\"So we worked with the doctor, and we said, OK, let's test this, we can use data to try and understand this relationship,\" he explains. While the two did correlate, there was a significant additional factor: how much time those who were depressed or anxious spent alone. Ultimately, it was loneliness that was driving their mental health struggles, the study suggested, rather than screen time by itself. Then there are the missing details about the nature of the screen time itself: the term is far too nebulous, argues Prof Etchells. Was it uplifting screen time? Was it useful? Informative? Or was it \"doomscrolling\"? Was the young person alone or were they interacting online with friends? Each factor generates a different experience. One study by US and UK researchers looked at 11,500 brain scans of children aged 9 to 12 alongside health assessments and their own reported screen time use. While patterns of screen use were linked to changes in how brain regions connect, the study found no evidence that screen time was linked to poor mental well-being or cognitive issues, even among those using screens for several hours of the day.The study, which ran from 2016 to 2018, was supervised by Oxford University Professor Andrew Przybylski, who has studied the impact of video games and social media on mental health. His peer-reviewed studies indicate that both can, in fact, boost wellbeing rather than damage it.Prof Etchells says: \"If you think that screens do change brains for the worse, you would see that signal in a big data set like that. But you don't… so this idea that screens are changing brains in a consistently or enduringly bad way, that just doesn't seem to be the case.\" This view is echoed by Professor Chris Chambers, head of brain stimulation at Cardiff University, who is quoted in Prof Etchells' book as saying, \"It would be obvious if there was a decline.\"It would be easy to look at the last, say, 15 years of research… If our cognitive system was so fragile to changes in the environment, we wouldn't be here. \"We'd have been selected for extinction a very long time ago.\" Neither Prof Przybylski nor Prof Etchells dispute the grave threat of certain online harms, such as grooming and exposure to explicit or harmful content. But both argue that the current debate around screen time is in danger of driving it further underground.Prof Przybylski is concerned about arguments for limiting devices or even banning them - and believes that the more rigidly screen time is policed, the more of a \"forbidden fruit\" it could become. Many disagree. The UK campaign group Smartphone Free Childhood says 150,000 people have so far signed its pact to ban smartphones for children below the age of 14, and delay social media access until the age of 16. When Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology from San Diego State University, began researching rising depression rates among US teenagers, she did not set out to prove that social media and smartphones were \"terrible,\" she tells me. But she found it to be the only common denominator.Today, she believes separating children and screens is a no-brainer, and is urging parents to keep children and smartphones apart for as long as possible.\"[Children's] brains are more developed and more mature at 16,\" she argues. \"And the social environment at school and friend groups is much more stable at 16 than it is at 12.\" While she does agree that the data gathered on young people's screen use is largely self-reported, she argues that this does not dilute the evidence.One Danish study published in 2024 involved 181 children from 89 families. For two weeks, half of them were limited to three hours of screen time per week and asked to hand in their tablets and smartphones. It concluded that reducing screen media \"positively affected psychological symptoms of children and adolescents\" and enhanced \"prosocial behaviour\", although added that further research was needed.And a UK study in which participants were asked to record time diaries of their screen time found that higher social media use aligned with higher reported feelings of depression in girls.\"You take that formula: More time online, usually alone with a screen; less time sleeping; less time with friends in person. That is a terrible formula for mental health,\" says Prof Twenge. \"I have no idea why that's controversial.\" When Prof Etchells and I speak, it is via video chat. One of his children and his dog wander in and out. I ask whether screens are really re-wiring children's brains and he laughs, explaining that everything changes the brain: that's how humans learn. But he is also clearly sympathetic towards parental fears about the potential harms. It doesn't help parents that there is little clear guidance - and that the topic is fraught with bias and judgement. Jenny Radesky, a paediatrician at the University of Michigan, summed this up when she spoke at the philanthropic Dana Foundation. There is \"an increasingly judgmental discourse among parents,\" she argued.\"So much of what people are talking about does more to induce parental guilt, it seems, than to break down what the research can tell us,\" she said. \"And that's a real problem.\"The debate: Should smartphones be banned for under 16s?Mobile ban in schools not improving grades or behaviour, study suggestsGrowing number of teens trust social media for newsLooking back, my youngest child's tantrum over the iPad alarmed me at the time - but on reflection I've experienced similar performances over non-screen related activities: like when he was playing hide and seek with his brothers and didn't want to get ready for bed.Screen time comes up a lot in my conversations with other parents too. Some of us are stricter than others.The official advice is currently inconsistent. Neither the US American Academy of Paediatrics nor the UK's Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health recommend any specific time limits for children. The World Health Organization, meanwhile, suggests no screen time at all for children below the age of one, and no more than one hour per day for under-fours (although when you read the policy this is aimed at prioritising physical activity).There is a bigger issue here in that there is simply not enough science to make a definitive recommendation, and this is dividing the scientific community - despite a strong societal push to limit children's access.And without set guidelines, are we setting up an uneven playing field for children who are already tech-savvy by adulthood, and others who are not and are arguably more vulnerable as a result?Either way, the stakes are high. If screens really are damaging children, it might be years before the science catches up and proves it. Or if it eventually concludes that it isn't, we would have wasted energy and money and, in the process, tried to keep children away from something that can also be extremely useful.And, all the while, with screens becoming glasses, social media regrouping around smaller communities, and people using AI chatbots to help with homework or even for therapy - the tech that's already in our lives is rapidly evolving, whether or not we let our children access it.Illustrator: Jodi Lai BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

{"title": "Meta profits surge helps drive Zuckerberg’s AI ambitions", "content": "Social media giant Meta Platforms says its profits soared and it is pumping billions of dollars more into artificial intelligence (AI) projects.The firm - which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp - says revenue for the three months to the end of June rose 22% from the same period last year to $47.5bn (£35.86bn), while profits jumped by 36% to $18.3bn.At the same time expenses are also rising - up 12% to $27bn - as the company ploughs money into fulfilling chief executive Mark Zuckerberg’s AI ambitions, and its spending is expected to keep rising.Meta says the cost of building infrastructure, including servers and data centres, and workers' pay packages will be its biggest expenses. Before Meta's earnings announcement on Wednesday, Zuckerberg posted a video on Instagram describing his plans for developing what he called \"AI Superintelligence\" that surpasses \"human intelligence to solve complex problems\".He also said Meta will create \"personal superintelligence\" that uses advanced AI for everyday tasks such as helping users remember things like wedding anniversaries and then making reservations or ordering a gift.Mike Proulx from research and advisory firm Forrester said Meta is helping \"future-proof itself as a growth company\" in the event that its current offerings falter.Meta has been seeking to catch up with rival artificial intelligence developers like OpenAI and Google after the release of Llama 4 family of large language models (LLMs) left some users and investors disappointed.It has offered $100m pay packages to top AI talent to lure them away from competitors.Meta has also spent more than $14bn on a stake in artificial intelligence firm ScaleAI and brought in its chief executive Alexandr Wang to help spearhead its efforts.Zuckerberg’s strategy has been to use the strength of Meta's core businesses to help fund its AI projects.He said 3.4 billion people around the world use at least one Meta app every day.Meta has also deployed AI to improve its advertising business.But the the cost of developing superintelligence have raised concerns among some analysts.\"AI-driven investments into Meta's advertising business continue to pay off, bolstering its revenue as the company pours billions of dollars into AI ambitions like superintelligence,” said Minda Smiley from market research firm Emarketer.“But Meta's exorbitant spending on its AI visions will continue to draw questions and scrutiny from investors who are eager to see returns,“ she added.Meta's shares jumped by more than 10% in extended trading in New York after its earnings announcement.

{"title": "TikTok removes video by Huda Beauty boss over anti-Israel conspiracy theories", "content": "TikTok has removed a video by businesswoman and beauty influencer Huda Kattan in which she promoted conspiracy theories about Israel.The Iraqi-American entrepreneur, who is founder and CEO of the popular Huda Beauty brand, said in a video posted on Sunday that Israel was responsible for \"every world war\" including World War One and World War Two, as well as the September 11 and 7 October attacks.The American Jewish Committee said she was \"using her massive platform to spread vile antisemitic conspiracy theories\".TikTok confirmed it removed the video on Tuesday for violating its community guidelines, but did not give further comment. Kattan and Huda Beauty have not responded to requests for comment. The state of Israel was founded in 1948. World War One ended in 1918, and World War Two, during which millions of Jews were murdered in the Nazi Holocaust, ended in 1945.In the video to her 1.7 million followers, Kattan claimed there was evidence that \"Israel has been behind World War One, World War Two\", as well as al-Qaeda's 11 September 2001 attacks on the US and the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\"I had a feeling, I was like, were they behind every world war? Yes. Behind September 11th? Absolutely,\" she said.Kattan repeated a range of other claims including unfounded accusations that Israel protects paedophiles. \"These dangerous and historically baseless accusations echo some of the oldest and most pernicious antisemitic tropes,\" the Anti-Defamation League said in a statement.A spokesperson for the group, which aims to counter antisemitism, told the BBC: \"Having such a big platform for your business and choosing to use it to spread antisemitic conspiracy theories is inflammatory, irresponsible and dangerous.\"In a statement to BBC News, the American Jewish Committee said: \"This isn't 'criticism of Israel'. It's centuries-old hate, repackaged and broadcast to millions.\"A beauty company spreading this ugliness isn't just ironic - it's dangerous. We cannot and will not stay silent while anti-Jewish hatred is normalized. Words have real-life consequences. This rhetoric must be called out, exposed, and condemned.\"Kattan was named on the BBC 100 Women list in 2023 and was ranked 15th on Forbes magazine's list of the world's richest online creators that year.TikTok's community guidelines prohibit hate speech or promotion of hateful ideologies, as well misinformation that may cause significant harm, including conspiracy theories.Huda Beauty has 57 million followers on Instagram and is one of the world's most popular beauty brands.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93d7qlp974o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_date": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 16:16:28 GMT", "source": "bbc", "topic": "tech-regulation", "scraped_at": "2025-08-01T16:48:38.300975", "word_count": 413}

Everything you read on these pages is created by academics and journalists working together, supported by a team of digital technology experts. Our professional editors work with academics to turn knowledge and insights into easy-to-read articles, and make them accessible to general readers. All our work is free to read and free to republish under Creative Commons. We do this as a not-for-profit group guided by a clear purpose: to provide access to high-quality explanatory journalism that makes for better decision making. We place a high value on trust. All authors and editors sign up to our Editorial Charter and Guidelines. Contributors must abide by our Community Standards policy and be commissioned by editors before embarking on a written project for The Conversation. We only ask authors to write on subjects on which they have expertise. Potential conflicts of interest must be disclosed. The Conversation began in Melbourne, Australia, in March 2011, created and founded by Andrew Jaspan with the support of business strategist Jack Rejtman and the University of Melbourne Vice-Chancellor Glyn Davis.
